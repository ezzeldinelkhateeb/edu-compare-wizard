Summary : This figure illustrates the principle of hydraulic systems (Pascal's Law) using two connected pistons of different areas submerged in a hydraulic fluid, showing how a small force applied to a small piston results in a larger force on a larger piston due to pressure transmission.

illustration:
# Schematic Overview :
  • Two vertical cylinders (pistons) are connected at the base by a horizontal tube filled with hydraulic fluid (labeled "السائل الهيدروليكي").
  • The left piston (larger) has area A and is acted upon by an upward force F.
  • The right piston (smaller) has area a and is acted upon by a downward force f.
  • Both pistons are at the same horizontal fluid level (y₁ = y₂).

# Annotations & Labels :
  • Left piston: area labeled "A", force labeled "F", vertical position "y₁".
  • Right piston: area labeled "a", force labeled "f", vertical position "y₂".
  • The fluid is labeled in Arabic as "السائل الهيدروليكي".
  • Figure is labeled "(شكل 1)" (Figure 1).

# Accompanying Text (Key Equations & Concepts) :
  • States that when the pistons are at the same horizontal level, a force f applied to the small piston creates a pressure P at its base: P = f / a.
  • This pressure is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid to the base of the large piston, resulting in an upward force F: P = F / A.
  • The principle illustrated is Pascal's Law: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted equally in all directions.

# Analysis :
  • The figure visually demonstrates how a small input force on a small-area piston can generate a much larger output force on a large-area piston, provided the pressure is transmitted equally through the incompressible hydraulic fluid.
  • The mathematical relationships (P = f/a = F/A) are clearly shown, supporting the concept of force multiplication in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID 6bf01fc5-56dc-43ce-8f8d-2ba17a016523 -->

Summary : This illustration shows a hydraulic system with two connected cylinders of different cross-sectional areas, each fitted with a piston and subjected to different forces.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The system consists of two vertical cylinders connected at the base, forming a U-shape filled with liquid.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with piston area "A" and force "F" applied downward.
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area "a" and force "f" applied downward.
  • Both pistons are shown pressing down on the liquid, with the liquid level equal in both arms.
  • The diagram is labeled "شكل ۲" (Figure 2 in Persian/Arabic numerals).

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or units are provided.
  • The pistons are depicted as flat, circular disks.
  • The liquid is shown as a uniform blue fill, indicating it is incompressible and at equilibrium.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The larger cylinder (left) is wider and taller than the smaller cylinder (right).
  • The pistons are at the same vertical height, indicating equal liquid pressure at that level.
  • The force arrows (F and f) are both directed downward onto their respective pistons.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually demonstrates Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The system suggests that a small force "f" on the small piston can balance a larger force "F" on the large piston if the ratio of forces matches the ratio of areas (F/A = f/a).
  • The equal liquid levels reinforce the concept of pressure equilibrium in connected hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.061,t=0.476,r=0.270,b=0.615), with ID fcaadc99-9985-4323-a040-f03add0d4cef -->

# Title & Layout :
  • Title (top right): "حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار" ("Hydraulic piston states at equilibrium").
  • Three side-by-side schematic diagrams, each with a descriptive heading and associated equations.
  • Left and center diagrams: "المكبان في مستويين مختلفين" ("Pistons at different levels").
  • Right diagram: "المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي" ("Pistons at the same horizontal level").

# Left Diagram (Pistons at Different Levels, piston 1 higher) :
  • Shows two pistons (A and a) at different heights, with piston 1 higher than piston 2.
  • Forces: f applied on piston a, F on piston A.
  • Height difference h between pistons.
  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a = F/A + ρgh.

# Center Diagram (Pistons at Different Levels, piston 2 higher) :
  • Similar to left, but piston 2 is higher than piston 1.
  • Forces: f on piston a, F on piston A.
  • Height difference h.
  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a + ρgh = F/A.

# Right Diagram (Pistons at Same Level) :
  • Both pistons at the same horizontal level.
  • Forces: f on piston a, F on piston A.
  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a = F/A.

# Symbols & Notation :
  • f: force on small piston (a).
  • F: force on large piston (A).
  • a: area of small piston.
  • A: area of large piston.
  • h: height difference between pistons.
  • ρ: fluid density.
  • g: gravitational acceleration.
  • P₁, P₂: pressures at pistons 1 and 2.

# Analysis :
  • The diagrams and equations show that when pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal for both pistons (f/a = F/A).
  • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference due to the fluid column (ρgh) must be included in the force-area relationship.
  • The direction of the ρgh term depends on which piston is higher, as shown in the left and center diagrams. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID 1a74bea2-d295-4af3-9aa0-9f9549536a35 -->
