indicating ongoing maintenance or repair work.\n\nphoto:\nScene Overview :\n  • The main subjects are two white SUVs in a well-lit automotive repair shop.\n  • The elevated car is on a hydraulic lift, missing all four wheels, exposing the brake rotors and undercarriage.\n  • The second car is on the ground, positioned to the left, with its hood open, suggesting engine or diagnostic work.\n  • The setting includes industrial lighting, tiled walls, and various workshop tools and equipment in the background.\n  • The colour palette is dominated by whites, greys, and metallic tones, with some red accents (e.g., a post marked \"KIA\").\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No visible scale bar or measurement references.\n  • The license plate of the elevated car is partially visible: \"7200AP 136\".\n  • Workshop equipment includes tool cabinets, a waste bin, and a portable diagnostic or charging unit.\n  • The image is taken from a slightly low, wide-angle perspective, capturing both vehicles and much of the workshop environment.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The elevated car is positioned centrally and dominates the upper right of the image.\n  • The car on the ground is in the lower left, with its front facing rightward.\n  • The hydraulic lift and workshop equipment create a sense of depth and functional space.\n  • The composition follows a rule-of-thirds placement, with the main action (elevated car) in the upper right and supporting context (grounded car, tools) in the lower left.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The image visually communicates a professional automotive service environment, highlighting both routine maintenance (open hood) and more extensive repair (wheel removal).\n  • The presence of two cars in different stages of service suggests a busy, multi-bay workshop.\n  • The clean, organized setting and visible equipment reinforce the impression of a modern, well-equipped facility. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.000,t=0.004,r=0.997,b=0.397), with ID

container, with pressure and height variables annotated in Arabic.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • The main subject is a vertical cylindrical glass container filled with liquid.\n  • A piston (مكبس) is placed at the top, pressing down on the liquid.\n  • The piston is labeled with the external pressure Pa (ضغط خارجي).\n  • The liquid column beneath the piston is labeled with height h (ارتفاع).\n  • The pressure at a point A at the bottom of the liquid is labeled P(مكبس).\n  • The container is labeled as \"إناء زجاجي\" (glass vessel).\n  • The liquid is labeled as \"سائل\" (liquid).\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • All labels are in Arabic.\n  • The diagram uses arrows to indicate the direction of pressure applied by the piston.\n  • The point A at the bottom is marked with a dot and labeled \"A\".\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The piston is at the top, in contact with the liquid surface.\n  • The height h is measured vertically from the piston to point A at the bottom.\n  • The pressure Pa is applied from above, and P(مكبس) is at the bottom.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration visually explains how pressure is transmitted through a liquid by a piston, with clear labeling of variables relevant to fluid statics (Pa, h, P(مكبس), A).\n  • The setup is typical for demonstrating Pascal’s principle or hydrostatic pressure calculations. <!-- figure, from page 0

Arabic.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • The main subject is a vertical glass container (إناء زجاجي) filled with liquid (سائل).\n  • A movable piston (مكبس) with a weight (ثقل) on top is fitted into the container, sealing the liquid below.\n  • The piston is shown with arrows indicating applied atmospheric pressure (Pa) from above.\n  • The pressure at a point A at depth h below the piston is labeled as P(عند A).\n  • The illustration is in color, with the liquid shaded blue and the piston and weight in yellow/gray.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • Arabic labels: ثقل (weight), مكبس (piston), Pa (atmospheric pressure), إناء زجاجي (glass container), سائل (liquid), P(عند A) (pressure at A), h (depth), A (point in liquid).\n  • No scale bar or magnification is present.\n  • The diagram is schematic, not to scale.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The piston sits horizontally at the top of the liquid, with the weight directly above it.\n  • The depth h is marked vertically from the piston’s lower surface to point A in the liquid.\n  • Pressure arrows are shown acting downward on the piston and at point A.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration visually explains how pressure is transmitted through a liquid in a closed container, with pressure at depth h being influenced by both the atmospheric pressure above the piston and the weight on the piston.\n  • The diagram is suitable for teaching hydrostatics or fluid mechanics concepts, especially pressure in fluids. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.050,t=0.708,r=0.240,b=0.869), with ID 2622f36b-efa4-496b-abed-40d1ee877af4
