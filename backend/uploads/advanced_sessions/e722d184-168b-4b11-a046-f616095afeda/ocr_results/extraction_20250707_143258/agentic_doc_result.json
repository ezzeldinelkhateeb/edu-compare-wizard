positioned on hydraulic lifts for maintenance or inspection.\n\nphoto:\nScene Overview :\n  • The main subject is a group of cars inside a large, well-lit automotive workshop.\n  • The perspective is from ground level, looking diagonally across the workshop floor.\n  • The composition includes several cars, some elevated on blue hydraulic lifts and others parked on the ground.\n  • The lighting is bright and diffuse, likely from overhead skylights and large windows.\n  • The colour palette features a mix of metallic car colours (silver, orange, red, blue, black) and the blue of the lift structures.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No visible scale bar or measurement units.\n  • The hydraulic lifts are two-post types, painted blue.\n  • The workshop has a high ceiling with exposed beams and large glass windows.\n  • No visible text, signage, or user interface elements.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • Foreground: A silver car is elevated on a lift, with an orange car parked directly beneath it.\n  • Midground: Another orange car is elevated on a lift, with a black car parked below.\n  • Background: Additional cars (blue, red) are visible, parked on the ground.\n  • The cars and lifts are arranged in parallel rows, with clear yellow lines marking parking or work bays on the floor.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The image visually communicates the organized, professional environment of a modern automotive service center.\n  • The use of hydraulic lifts allows for efficient use of vertical space, enabling work on multiple vehicles simultaneously.\n  • The scene emphasizes the capacity and workflow of the facility, with a focus on maintenance or repair operations. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.004,t=0.161,r=0.712,b=0.512), with ID fadc219d-2888-4808-935a-0104db7cb8bc -->\n\nقاعدة

a piston compressing a liquid inside a glass container, with Arabic labels indicating pressure, height, and area.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • The main subject is a vertical cylindrical glass container filled with liquid.\n  • A piston (مكبس) is placed at the top, pressing down on the liquid.\n  • The piston is labeled with \"Pa\" (atmospheric pressure).\n  • The liquid surface is labeled, and a vertical arrow points downward from the piston to a point labeled \"A\" at the bottom.\n  • The height from the piston to point \"A\" is labeled \"h\".\n  • The pressure at the bottom is labeled \"P (مكبس)\".\n  • The container is labeled \"إناء زجاجي\" (glass vessel), and the liquid is labeled \"سائل\" (liquid).\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • The illustration uses simple colors: blue for the liquid, beige for the piston, and black for text and arrows.\n  • All labels are in Arabic, with some Latin symbols (Pa, P, h, A).\n  • No scale bar or numerical values are present.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The piston is at the top, directly above the liquid.\n  • The pressure is applied vertically downward.\n  • The height \"h\" is measured from the piston to the bottom point \"A\".\n  • The area \"A\" is at the base of the liquid column.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration visually explains the concept of pressure transmission in a liquid under a piston, likely for a physics or engineering context.\n  • The labeled variables (Pa, P, h, A) suggest the setup is used to derive or illustrate the pressure at a depth in a liquid under a piston. <!-- figure, from page 0

pressure term (labeled \"مكبس\" in Arabic, meaning \"piston\"), and the hydrostatic pressure component.\n\nequation:\n  • The equation shown is: P = Pₐ + P_(مكبس) + ρgh.\n  • P represents the total pressure.\n  • Pₐ denotes atmospheric pressure.\n  • P_(مكبس) refers to the pressure applied by a piston (as indicated by the Arabic word \"مكبس\").\n  • ρgh is the hydrostatic pressure term, where ρ is fluid density, g is gravitational acceleration, and h is height.\n\nDesign Elements :\n  • The equation is enclosed in a blue-bordered box.\n  • Subscripts and parenthetical Arabic text are used for clarity.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The equation summarizes how total pressure in a fluid system is the sum of atmospheric pressure, any additional applied pressure (such as from a piston), and the pressure due to the fluid's weight at a given depth. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.345,t=0.640,r=0.588,b=0.682), with ID 5d16d19b-3c7d-40ad-928b-bac1a97f23c4 -->\n\nحيث : (Pa) الضغط الجوي، (Pمكس)

for each component.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • The main subject is a vertical glass container (إناء زجاجي) filled with liquid (سائل).\n  • A movable piston (مكبس) with a weight (ثقل) on top is fitted into the container, sealing the liquid below.\n  • The piston is labeled with atmospheric pressure (Pa) acting downward.\n  • The pressure at the bottom of the piston is labeled as P(مكبس).\n  • The vertical distance from the piston to a point A at the bottom of the liquid is marked as h.\n  • The point at the bottom is labeled A.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • All labels are in Arabic, identifying the piston, weight, glass container, liquid, atmospheric pressure, piston pressure, height (h), and point A.\n  • No scale bar or magnification is present.\n  • The illustration uses simple colors: blue for the liquid, beige for the piston, and gray for the weight.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The piston sits horizontally at the top of the liquid, with the weight directly above it.\n  • The height h is measured vertically from the piston to the bottom point A.\n  • Arrows indicate the direction of pressure forces acting downward on the piston.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration visually explains how pressure is transmitted through a liquid in a closed container, with the piston and weight applying force to the liquid, and pressure at depth h being considered at point A. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.053,t=0.747,r=0.231,b=0.900), with ID c4bf0a24-2e3f-4c95-974a-416f81144060 -->\n\n$P = P_a + P_{(\\text{مكبس})} + \\rho gh + \\Delta P$ <!-- text, from page 0
