positioned on hydraulic lifts for maintenance or inspection.\n\nphoto:\nScene Overview :\n  • The main subject is a large, well-lit automotive workshop with a high ceiling and large windows.\n  • Several cars of various colors (silver, orange, red, blue, black) are visible, with some elevated on blue hydraulic lifts and others parked on the ground beneath or beside the lifts.\n  • The perspective is from ground level, looking diagonally across the workshop, capturing both foreground and background vehicles.\n  • The lighting is bright and diffuse, likely from natural daylight entering through the large windows and overhead lights.\n  • The color palette is dominated by the vibrant colors of the cars and the blue of the lift structures.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No visible scale bar or measurement references.\n  • No on-image text, UI elements, or labels.\n  • The hydraulic lifts are two-post types, painted blue, and are used to raise vehicles for undercarriage access.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • In the foreground, a silver car is elevated on a lift, with an orange car parked directly beneath it.\n  • To the left, another orange car is raised, with a black car parked below.\n  • In the background, additional cars are visible, some on lifts and some on the ground, arranged in parallel rows.\n  • The composition uses the rule of thirds, with the main elevated car occupying the right third of the image.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The image visually communicates the function and layout of a modern automotive service center, emphasizing the use of hydraulic lifts to maximize workspace efficiency.\n  • The arrangement of cars both above and below the lifts demonstrates the workshop's capacity to service multiple vehicles simultaneously.\n  • The clean, organized environment and ample lighting suggest a professional and well-maintained facility. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.004,t=0.161,r=0.712,b=0.512), with ID

This is a labeled illustration showing a piston compressing a liquid inside a glass container, with Arabic labels indicating pressure, height, and area.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • The main subject is a vertical glass container filled with liquid.\n  • A piston (مكبس) is placed at the top, pressing down on the liquid.\n  • The piston is labeled with \"Pa\" (atmospheric pressure).\n  • The liquid surface is labeled \"سائل\" (liquid).\n  • The container is labeled \"إناء زجاجي\" (glass vessel).\n  • A vertical arrow from the piston to a point at the bottom of the liquid is labeled \"h\" (height).\n  • The bottom point is labeled \"A\".\n  • The pressure at the bottom is labeled \"P (مكبس)\" (piston pressure).\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • The illustration uses simple colors: blue for the liquid, beige for the piston, and black for text and arrows.\n  • All labels are in Arabic, with some Latin letters for variables (Pa, P, h, A).\n  • No scale bar or numerical values are present.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The piston is at the top, directly above the liquid.\n  • The height \"h\" is measured vertically from the piston to the bottom point \"A\".\n  • The pressure is indicated as acting downward from the piston and at the bottom of the liquid.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration visually explains the concept of pressure transmission in a liquid under a piston, showing how pressure at the top (Pa) and the height of the liquid (h) relate to the pressure at the bottom (P) at point A. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.055,t=0.579,r=0.245,b=0.724), with ID

pressure (possibly from a piston), and the hydrostatic pressure due to fluid height.\n\nequation:\nFormula Components : \n  • P = Pa + P(مكبس) + ρgh\n  • Pa: Atmospheric pressure.\n  • P(مكبس): Additional pressure (labelled in Arabic as \"مكبس\", meaning \"piston\").\n  • ρ: Fluid density.\n  • g: Acceleration due to gravity.\n  • h: Height of the fluid column.\n\nContext & Notation : \n  • The formula is boxed with a blue border.\n  • The equation uses both Latin and Arabic script for variable labels.\n\nAnalysis : \n  • The formula expresses that the total pressure at a point in a fluid is the sum of atmospheric pressure, any extra applied pressure (such as from a piston), and the hydrostatic pressure from the fluid column above the point. <!-- figure, from page 0
