Summary : This is a labeled diagram and explanatory text illustrating the operation of a hydraulic press, showing how force and pressure are transmitted through a hydraulic fluid between two pistons of different areas.

illustration:
# Diagram Overview :
  • The diagram shows two connected cylinders (left: large, right: small) filled with hydraulic fluid (labeled "السائل الهيدروليكي").
  • The left cylinder has a large piston with area "A" and force "F" applied upward.
  • The right cylinder has a small piston with area "a" and force "f" applied downward.
  • The pistons are at the same horizontal level (y₁ = y₂).
  • Arrows indicate the direction of applied forces.
  • The system is labeled as "شكل (1)".

# Labeled Elements :
  • Large piston: area "A", force "F", height "y₁".
  • Small piston: area "a", force "f", height "y₂".
  • Connecting tube filled with hydraulic fluid.
  • Forces and areas are clearly marked.

# Explanatory Text (Arabic) :
  • Describes that when the pistons are at the same horizontal level, a force "f" is applied to the small piston.
  • The resulting pressure "P" under the small piston is given by P = f / a.
  • This pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid to the large piston.
  • The force "F" on the large piston is given by F = P × A, or P = F / A.

# Analysis :
  • The diagram and text together explain Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The system demonstrates how a small force applied to a small-area piston can generate a larger force on a larger-area piston, forming the basis of hydraulic presses.
  • The mathematical relationships P = f / a and P = F / A are highlighted, showing the proportionality between force and piston area. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID 3fe97d05-7bde-4fcf-b9dd-10a3bb271dea -->

Summary : This illustration demonstrates the principle of hydraulic systems, showing how a force applied to a large piston is transmitted through an incompressible fluid to a smaller piston, resulting in a different force output.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The image shows two vertical cylinders of different diameters connected at the base by a U-shaped tube filled with liquid.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with piston area "A" and force "F" applied downward on the piston.
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area "a" and force "f" applied downward on the piston.
  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.
  • The pistons are depicted as flat disks fitting tightly in their respective cylinders.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or explicit units are shown.
  • The diagram is schematic, with clear labeling of forces and areas.
  • The text below the image is in Persian (Farsi), reading "شکل ۲" which translates to "Figure 2".

Spatial Relationships :
  • The larger piston (left) and smaller piston (right) are horizontally aligned at the liquid surface.
  • The U-shaped tube connects the two cylinders at the base, allowing pressure transmission.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually represents Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The setup suggests that the ratio of forces to areas (F/A = f/a) is key, illustrating mechanical advantage in hydraulic systems.
  • The equal liquid levels indicate static equilibrium, reinforcing the concept of pressure balance. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.061,t=0.476,r=0.270,b=0.615), with ID f4bb5ebe-c48d-4441-906f-b5fad68ded62 -->

Summary : This figure illustrates the different equilibrium states of a hydraulic piston system, showing how the positions of the pistons (at the same or different levels) affect the pressure relationships and force equations.

diagram:
# Title :
  • Title in Arabic: "حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار" (States of the Hydraulic Piston at Equilibrium).

# Layout & Sections :
  • The figure is divided into three vertical panels, each showing a U-shaped hydraulic system with two pistons labeled 1 and 2.
  • Each panel is labeled at the top:
    – Left and center: "المكبان في مستويين مختلفين" (Pistons at Different Levels).
    – Right: "المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي" (Pistons at the Same Horizontal Level).

# Diagrams & Variables :
  • Each panel shows:
    – Two pistons (1 and 2) with areas a and A, and forces f and F applied.
    – Fluid columns with height difference h between pistons in the left and center panels.
    – Fluid density ρ and gravitational acceleration g indicated in equations.
    – Pressure at points under each piston labeled P₁ and P₂.
    – Dashed lines indicating reference levels for height h.

# Equations :
  • Left panel:
    – P₁ = P₂
    – f/a = F/A + ρgh
  • Center panel:
    – P₁ = P₂
    – f/a + ρgh = F/A
  • Right panel:
    – P₁ = P₂
    – f/a = F/A

# Analysis :
  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at different heights, the pressure balance includes a term for the hydrostatic pressure difference (ρgh).
  • When pistons are at the same horizontal level, the pressure relationship simplifies to f/a = F/A, showing direct proportionality between force and area.
  • The diagrams visually reinforce the effect of piston height on the force and pressure equations in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID 079bcae8-c2ff-4e34-b59a-aa8a54412531 -->
