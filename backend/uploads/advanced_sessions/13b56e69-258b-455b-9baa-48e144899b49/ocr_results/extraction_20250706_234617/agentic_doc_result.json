 • The pistons are at the same horizontal level (y₁ = y₂).\n  • Arrows indicate the direction of applied forces.\n  • The system is labeled as \"شكل (1)\".\n\n# Labeled Elements :\n  • Large piston: area \"A\", force \"F\", height \"y₁\".\n  • Small piston: area \"a\", force \"f\", height \"y₂\".\n  • Connecting tube filled with hydraulic fluid.\n  • Forces and areas are clearly marked.\n\n# Explanatory Text (Arabic) :\n  • Describes that when the pistons are at the same horizontal level, a force \"f\" is applied to the small piston.\n  • The resulting pressure \"P\" under the small piston is given by P = f / a.\n  • This pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid to the large piston.\n  • The force \"F\" on the large piston is given by F = P × A, or P = F / A.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The diagram and text together explain Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.\n  • The system demonstrates how a small force applied to a small-area piston can generate a larger force on a larger-area piston, forming the basis of hydraulic presses.\n  • The mathematical relationships P = f / a and P = F / A are highlighted, showing the proportionality between force and piston area. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID 3fe97d05-7bde-4fcf-b9dd-10a3bb271dea -->\n\n- إذا تسببت

demonstrates the principle of hydraulic systems, showing how a force applied to a large piston is transmitted through an incompressible fluid to a smaller piston, resulting in a different force output.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • The image shows two vertical cylinders of different diameters connected at the base by a U-shaped tube filled with liquid.\n  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with piston area \"A\" and force \"F\" applied downward on the piston.\n  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area \"a\" and force \"f\" applied downward on the piston.\n  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.\n  • The pistons are depicted as flat disks fitting tightly in their respective cylinders.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No scale bar or explicit units are shown.\n  • The diagram is schematic, with clear labeling of forces and areas.\n  • The text below the image is in Persian (Farsi), reading \"شکل ۲\" which translates to \"Figure 2\".\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The larger piston (left) and smaller piston (right) are horizontally aligned at the liquid surface.\n  • The U-shaped tube connects the two cylinders at the base, allowing pressure transmission.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The figure visually represents Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.\n  • The setup suggests that the ratio of forces to areas (F/A = f/a) is key, illustrating mechanical advantage in hydraulic systems.\n  • The equal liquid levels indicate static equilibrium, reinforcing the concept of pressure balance. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.061,t=0.476,r=0.270,b=0.615), with ID f4bb5ebe-c48d-4441-906f-b5fad68ded62 -->\n\n- لكي يعود الكبسان في مستوى

figure illustrates the different equilibrium states of a hydraulic piston system, showing how the positions of the pistons (at the same or different levels) affect the pressure relationships and force equations.\n\ndiagram:\n# Title :\n  • Title in Arabic: \"حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار\" (States of the Hydraulic Piston at Equilibrium).\n\n# Layout & Sections :\n  • The figure is divided into three vertical panels, each showing a U-shaped hydraulic system with two pistons labeled 1 and 2.\n  • Each panel is labeled at the top:\n    – Left and center: \"المكبان في مستويين مختلفين\" (Pistons at Different Levels).\n    – Right: \"المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي\" (Pistons at the Same Horizontal Level).\n\n# Diagrams & Variables :\n  • Each panel shows:\n    – Two pistons (1 and 2) with areas a and A, and forces f and F applied.\n    – Fluid columns with height difference h between pistons in the left and center panels.\n    – Fluid density ρ and gravitational acceleration g indicated in equations.\n    – Pressure at points under each piston labeled P₁ and P₂.\n    – Dashed lines indicating reference levels for height h.\n\n# Equations :\n  • Left panel:\n    – P₁ = P₂\n    – f/a = F/A + ρgh\n  • Center panel:\n    – P₁ = P₂\n    – f/a + ρgh = F/A\n  • Right panel:\n    – P₁ = P₂\n    – f/a = F/A\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at different heights, the pressure balance includes a term for the hydrostatic pressure difference (ρgh).\n  • When pistons are at the same horizontal level, the pressure relationship simplifies to f/a = F/A, showing direct proportionality between force and area.\n  • The diagrams visually reinforce the effect of piston height on the force and pressure equations in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from

      "text": "Summary : This figure illustrates the different equilibrium states of a hydraulic piston system, showing how the positions of the pistons (at the same or different levels) affect the pressure relationships and force equations.\n\ndiagram:\n# Title :\n  • Title in Arabic: \"حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار\" (States of the Hydraulic Piston at Equilibrium).\n\n# Layout & Sections :\n  • The figure is divided into three vertical panels, each showing a U-shaped hydraulic system with two pistons labeled 1 and 2.\n  • Each panel is labeled at the top:\n    – Left and center: \"المكبان في مستويين مختلفين\" (Pistons at Different Levels).\n    – Right: \"المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي\" (Pistons at the Same Horizontal Level).\n\n# Diagrams & Variables :\n  • Each panel shows:\n    – Two pistons (1 and 2) with areas a and A, and forces f and F applied.\n    – Fluid columns with height difference h between pistons in the left and center panels.\n    – Fluid density ρ and gravitational acceleration g indicated in equations.\n    – Pressure at points under each piston labeled P₁ and P₂.\n    – Dashed lines indicating reference levels for height h.\n\n# Equations :\n  • Left panel:\n    – P₁ = P₂\n    – f/a = F/A + ρgh\n  • Center panel:\n    – P₁ = P₂\n    – f/a + ρgh = F/A\n  • Right panel:\n    – P₁ = P₂\n    – f/a = F/A\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at different heights, the pressure balance includes a term for the hydrostatic pressure difference (ρgh).\n  • When pistons are at the same horizontal level, the pressure relationship simplifies to f/a = F/A, showing direct proportionality between force and area.\n  • The diagrams visually reinforce the effect of piston height on the force and pressure equations in hydraulic systems.",
