  "markdown": "Summary : This is a labeled diagram and explanatory text illustrating the operation of a hydraulic press, showing how force applied to a small piston is transmitted through a hydraulic fluid to a larger piston, with mathematical relationships for pressure and force.\n\nillustration:\n# Diagram Overview :\n  • The diagram shows two connected cylinders (left and right) filled with hydraulic fluid (labeled \"السائل الهيدروليكي\").\n  • The left cylinder has a large piston with area \"A\" and force \"F\" applied upward.\n  • The right cylinder has a small piston with area \"a\" and force \"f\" applied downward.\n  • The heights of the fluid under each piston are labeled \"y1\" (left) and \"y2\" (right).\n  • The two cylinders are connected at the base, allowing fluid to transmit pressure.\n\n# Mathematical Relationships :\n  • The pressure under the small piston is given by: P = f / a\n  • This pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid to the large piston.\n  • The force on the large piston is given by: F = P × A, or rearranged, P = F / A\n\n# Explanatory Text (Arabic) :\n  • Describes that when the pistons are at the same horizontal level and a force \"f\" is applied to the small piston, a pressure \"P\" is generated under it.\n  • This pressure is transmitted through the fluid to the large piston, resulting in an upward force \"F\".\n  • The relationships between force, area, and pressure are explicitly stated.\n\n# Labels and Notations :\n  • \"A\" = area of large piston, \"a\" = area of small piston.\n  • \"F\" = force on large piston, \"f\" = force on small piston.\n  • \"y1\", \"y2\" = fluid heights under each piston.\n  • \"P\" = pressure.\n  • \"السائل الهيدروليكي\" = hydraulic fluid.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The diagram and equations visually and mathematically demonstrate Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.\n  • The setup shows how a small force applied to a small piston can generate a much larger force on a larger piston, depending on the ratio of their areas.\n  • The illustration is clear, with all variables labeled and the physical principle explained step by step. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID 30779f00-6f3d-4b75-b910-161ce2955362 -->\n\n- إذا تسببت القوة F في تحريك المكبس الصغير مسافة 𝑦₁

the relationship between force, area, and pressure when the pistons are at the same or different heights, with corresponding equations.\n\ndiagram:\n# Title :\n  • Main title (top right): \"حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار\" (\"States of the Hydraulic Piston at Equilibrium\").\n  • Subtitles for each panel: \n    – Left and center: \"المكبان في مستويين مختلفين\" (\"Pistons at Different Levels\").\n    – Right: \"المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي\" (\"Pistons at the Same Horizontal Level\").\n\n# Panels & Diagrams :\n  • Three side-by-side schematic diagrams, each showing a U-shaped hydraulic system with two pistons (labeled 1 and 2) of different areas (a and A) and forces (f and F).\n  • Left and center panels: Pistons are at different heights, with a height difference \"h\" marked.\n  • Right panel: Both pistons are at the same horizontal level.\n\n# Equations & Annotations :\n  • All panels show the pressure equality: \"P₁ = P₂\".\n  • Left and center panels: \n    – Equation: f/a = F/A + ρgh\n    – Or rearranged: f/a + ρgh = F/A\n    – \"h\" is the height difference, \"ρ\" is fluid density, \"g\" is gravity.\n  • Right panel: \n    – Equation: f/a = F/A\n    – No height difference term.\n\n# Labels & Symbols :\n  • Pistons labeled \"1\" and \"2\".\n  • Forces: \"f\" (small piston), \"F\" (large piston).\n  • Areas: \"a\" (small piston), \"A\" (large piston).\n  • Height difference: \"h\" (between fluid levels).\n  • Fluid shown in blue, with arrows indicating force directions.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same horizontal level, the force-to-area ratio is equal on both sides (f/a = F/A).\n  • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference due to the fluid column (ρgh) must be included in the force balance.\n  • The diagrams and equations together clarify how hydraulic equilibrium depends on both force/area and fluid height differences. <!-- figure, from page 0
