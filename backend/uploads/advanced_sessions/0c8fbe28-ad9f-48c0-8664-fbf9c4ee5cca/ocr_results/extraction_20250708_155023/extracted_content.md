Summary : This is a labeled diagram and explanatory text illustrating the operation of a hydraulic press, showing how force applied to a small piston is transmitted through a hydraulic fluid to a larger piston, with mathematical relationships for pressure and force.

illustration:
# Diagram Overview :
  • The diagram shows two connected cylinders (left and right) filled with hydraulic fluid (labeled "السائل الهيدروليكي").
  • The left cylinder has a large piston with area "A" and force "F" applied upward.
  • The right cylinder has a small piston with area "a" and force "f" applied downward.
  • The heights of the fluid under each piston are labeled "y1" (left) and "y2" (right).
  • The two cylinders are connected at the base, allowing fluid to transmit pressure.

# Mathematical Relationships :
  • The pressure under the small piston is given by: P = f / a
  • This pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid to the large piston.
  • The force on the large piston is given by: F = P × A, or rearranged, P = F / A

# Explanatory Text (Arabic) :
  • Describes that when the pistons are at the same horizontal level and a force "f" is applied to the small piston, a pressure "P" is generated under it.
  • This pressure is transmitted through the fluid to the large piston, resulting in an upward force "F".
  • The relationships between force, area, and pressure are explicitly stated.

# Labels and Notations :
  • "A" = area of large piston, "a" = area of small piston.
  • "F" = force on large piston, "f" = force on small piston.
  • "y1", "y2" = fluid heights under each piston.
  • "P" = pressure.
  • "السائل الهيدروليكي" = hydraulic fluid.

Analysis :
  • The diagram and equations visually and mathematically demonstrate Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The setup shows how a small force applied to a small piston can generate a much larger force on a larger piston, depending on the ratio of their areas.
  • The illustration is clear, with all variables labeled and the physical principle explained step by step. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID 30779f00-6f3d-4b75-b910-161ce2955362 -->

Summary : This illustration demonstrates the principle of hydraulic systems, showing how a force applied to a larger piston is transmitted through an incompressible fluid to a smaller piston, resulting in a different force output.

illustration:
Hydraulic System Setup :
  • Two vertical cylinders of different diameters are connected at the base by a horizontal tube, forming a U-shaped vessel filled with liquid.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with piston area "A" and downward force "F" applied to its piston.
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area "a" and downward force "f" applied to its piston.
  • Both pistons are shown pressing down on the liquid, with the liquid level equal in both arms.

Labels & Notation :
  • Left piston: "A" (area), "F" (force).
  • Right piston: "a" (area), "f" (force).
  • Dashed line indicates equal liquid level.
  • Caption in Persian: "(شکل ۲)" meaning "Figure 2".

Spatial Relationships :
  • The larger piston (left) and smaller piston (right) are at the same vertical height, indicating equilibrium.
  • The system visually represents Pascal's principle, where pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually explains how a small force applied to a small-area piston can balance a larger force on a larger-area piston, provided the pressure (F/A = f/a) is equal.
  • This is a classic demonstration of hydraulic multiplication and equilibrium in fluids. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.061,t=0.476,r=0.270,b=0.615), with ID e323dbf5-e81b-47f8-a581-e621d1f75447 -->

Summary : This figure illustrates the different equilibrium states of a hydraulic piston system, showing the relationship between force, area, and pressure when the pistons are at the same or different heights, with corresponding equations.

diagram:
# Title :
  • Main title (top right): "حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار" ("States of the Hydraulic Piston at Equilibrium").
  • Subtitles for each panel: 
    – Left and center: "المكبان في مستويين مختلفين" ("Pistons at Different Levels").
    – Right: "المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي" ("Pistons at the Same Horizontal Level").

# Panels & Diagrams :
  • Three side-by-side schematic diagrams, each showing a U-shaped hydraulic system with two pistons (labeled 1 and 2) of different areas (a and A) and forces (f and F).
  • Left and center panels: Pistons are at different heights, with a height difference "h" marked.
  • Right panel: Both pistons are at the same horizontal level.

# Equations & Annotations :
  • All panels show the pressure equality: "P₁ = P₂".
  • Left and center panels: 
    – Equation: f/a = F/A + ρgh
    – Or rearranged: f/a + ρgh = F/A
    – "h" is the height difference, "ρ" is fluid density, "g" is gravity.
  • Right panel: 
    – Equation: f/a = F/A
    – No height difference term.

# Labels & Symbols :
  • Pistons labeled "1" and "2".
  • Forces: "f" (small piston), "F" (large piston).
  • Areas: "a" (small piston), "A" (large piston).
  • Height difference: "h" (between fluid levels).
  • Fluid shown in blue, with arrows indicating force directions.

# Analysis :
  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same horizontal level, the force-to-area ratio is equal on both sides (f/a = F/A).
  • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference due to the fluid column (ρgh) must be included in the force balance.
  • The diagrams and equations together clarify how hydraulic equilibrium depends on both force/area and fluid height differences. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID 92d85687-bdc1-4d6a-bdad-b42e8fb524c8 -->
