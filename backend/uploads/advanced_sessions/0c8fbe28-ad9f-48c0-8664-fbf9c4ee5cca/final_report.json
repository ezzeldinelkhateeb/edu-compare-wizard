between applied forces, areas, and heights on both sides.\n\nillustration:\nHydraulic Press Principle :\n  • The diagram shows a U-shaped container filled with hydraulic fluid (labeled \"السانل الهيدروليكي\").\n  • On the left side, a large piston with area \"A\" is acted upon by an upward force \"F\".\n  • On the right side, a smaller piston with area \"a\" is acted upon by a downward force \"f\".\n  • The heights of the fluid columns under each piston are labeled \"y2\" (left) and \"y1\" (right).\n  • The pistons and fluid levels are clearly marked, and the system is labeled as \"شكل (1)\".\n\nLabels & Notation :\n  • Left piston: Area \"A\", force \"F\", height \"y2\".\n  • Right piston: Area \"a\", force \"f\", height \"y1\".\n  • The fluid is labeled as \"السانل الهيدروليكي\" (hydraulic fluid).\n  • The diagram is referenced as \"شكل (1)\" (Figure 1).\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The left piston is larger and at a higher fluid level than the right piston.\n  • The right piston is smaller and at a lower fluid level.\n  • The U-tube connects both pistons, allowing pressure transmission through the fluid.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The diagram visually demonstrates Pascal's

base by a U-shaped tube filled with liquid.\n  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with piston area \"A\" and force \"F\" applied downward.\n  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area \"a\" and force \"f\" applied downward.\n  • Both pistons are shown pressing down on the liquid, with the liquid level equal in both arms.\n\nLabels & Notation :\n  • Left piston: \"A\" (area),

2).\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The larger piston (left) and smaller piston (right) are at the top of their respective cylinders.\n  • The liquid is continuous and at the same height in both arms, indicating equilibrium.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The figure visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.\n  • The ratio of forces to areas (F/A = f/a) is implied, illustrating how a small force on a small piston can balance a larger force on a larger piston, or vice versa.\n  • The system is in static equilibrium, as

two pistons, comparing cases where the pistons are at different levels versus the same horizontal level, and provides the corresponding pressure equations.\n\ndiagram:\n# Left and Center Panels: Pistons at Different Levels :\n  • Both panels show a U-shaped tube filled with liquid, with two pistons (labeled 1 and 2) of different areas (a and A) on each side.\n  • The left panel shows piston 1 at a lower level than piston 2, with a height difference h.\n  • The center panel shows piston 1 at a higher level than piston 2, again with a height difference h.\n  • Both panels indicate forces applied: f on piston 1 (area a), F on piston 2 (area A).\n  • The pressure equality is given as P₁ = P₂.\n  • The pressure equation is: f/a = F/A + ρgh, where ρ is the fluid density and g is gravitational acceleration.\n\n# Right Panel: Pistons at the Same Level :\n  • Shows a U-shaped tube with both pistons at the same horizontal level.\n  • Forces f and F are applied to pistons 1 and 2, with areas a and A, respectively.\n  • The pressure equality is P₁ = P₂.\n  • The pressure equation simplifies to: f/a = F/A.\n\n# Headings and Labels :\n  • Top left and center: \"المكبسـان في مستويين مختلفين\" (The pistons at different levels).\n  • Top right: \"المكبسـان في نفس المستـوى الأفقي\" (The pistons at the same horizontal level).\n  • Variables: f, F (forces); a, A (areas); h (height difference); ρ (density); g (gravity).\n\n# Analysis :\n  • When the pistons are at different heights, the pressure equation includes the hydrostatic term ρgh, accounting for the height difference.\n  • When the pistons are at the same level, the hydrostatic term vanishes, and the pressure ratio depends only on the force and area ratios.\n  • The diagrams visually reinforce the effect of height difference on pressure transmission in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.651,r=0.888,b=0.892), with ID 6c63a7cc-a0a0-4da1-841f-447f20211fd2 -->\n\nحيث : (ρ)

hydraulic system with two pistons (labeled 1 and 2) of different areas (a and A) and forces (f and F).\n  • Left and center panels: Pistons are at different heights, with a height difference \"h\" marked.\n  • Right panel: Both pistons are at the same horizontal level.\n\n# Equations & Annotations :\n  • All panels show the pressure equality: \"P₁ = P₂\".\n  • Left and center panels: \n    – Equation: f/a = F/A + ρgh\n    – Or rearranged: f/a + ρgh = F/A\n    – \"h\" is the height difference, \"ρ\" is fluid density, \"g\" is gravity.\n  • Right panel: \n    – Equation: f/a = F/A\n    – No height difference term.\n\n# Labels & Symbols :\n  • Pistons labeled \"1\" and \"2\".\n  • Forces: \"f\" (small piston), \"F\" (large piston).\n  • Areas: \"a\" (small piston), \"A\" (large piston).\n  • Height difference: \"h\" (between fluid levels).\n  • Fluid shown in blue, with arrows indicating force directions.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same horizontal level, the force-to-area ratio is equal on both sides (f/a = F/A).\n  • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference due to the fluid column (ρgh) must be included in the force balance.\n  • The diagrams and equations together clarify how hydraulic equilibrium depends on both force/area and fluid height differences. <!-- figure, from page 0
