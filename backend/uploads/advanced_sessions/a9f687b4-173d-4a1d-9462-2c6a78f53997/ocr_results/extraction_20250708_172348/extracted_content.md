Summary : This is a labeled illustration and explanatory text describing the operation of a hydraulic press, showing how force applied to a small piston is transmitted through a hydraulic fluid to a larger piston, with mathematical relationships for pressure and force.

illustration:
# Diagram :
  • Shows two connected cylinders (left: large, right: small) filled with hydraulic fluid (labeled "السائل الهيدروليكي").
  • Left cylinder: large piston with area "A" and force "F" applied upward.
  • Right cylinder: small piston with area "a" and force "f" applied downward.
  • Heights "y1" and "y2" are marked for the fluid levels in each cylinder.
  • The two cylinders are connected at the base, allowing fluid communication.

# Mathematical Relationships :
  • Pressure under the small piston: \( P = \frac{f}{a} \)
  • Pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid to the large piston.
  • Force on the large piston: \( F = P \times A \) or \( P = \frac{F}{A} \)

# Explanatory Text (Arabic) :
  • Describes that when the pistons are at the same horizontal level and a force "f" is applied to the small piston, a pressure "P" is generated beneath it.
  • This pressure is transmitted uniformly through the hydraulic fluid to the large piston.
  • The result is an upward force "F" on the large piston, with the relationship between force, area, and pressure given by the equations above.

# Analysis :
  • The illustration and equations demonstrate Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished in all directions.
  • The system allows a small force applied to a small area to generate a larger force on a larger area, explaining the mechanical advantage of hydraulic presses. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID 5bf68bfd-806d-4a28-9f13-e20372d8724d -->

Summary : This illustration shows a hydraulic system with two connected cylinders of different cross-sectional areas, each fitted with a piston and subjected to different forces.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The image depicts two vertical cylinders connected at the base by a horizontal tube, forming a U-shaped container filled with liquid.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with piston area "A" and force "F" applied downward.
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area "a" and force "f" applied downward.
  • Both pistons are shown pressing down on the liquid, with the liquid level equal in both arms.
  • The diagram is labeled "شكل ۲" (Figure 2 in Persian/Arabic numerals).

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or units are provided.
  • The pistons are circular and fit tightly in their respective cylinders.
  • The liquid is shown as a uniform blue fill, indicating an incompressible fluid.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The larger cylinder (left) and smaller cylinder (right) are connected at the base, allowing pressure transmission.
  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.
  • The forces F and f are applied vertically downward on the pistons.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually demonstrates Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The system suggests that a small force on the small piston (right) can balance a larger force on the large piston (left) if the area ratio is appropriate (F/A = f/a).
  • The equal liquid levels indicate static equilibrium, with pressures at the same horizontal level being equal. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.061,t=0.476,r=0.270,b=0.615), with ID bf806436-5b5f-471d-bf90-e914980f8819 -->

# Title & Layout :
  • Title at top: "حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار" ("States of the Hydraulic Piston at Equilibrium").
  • Three side-by-side panels, each showing a U-shaped hydraulic system with two pistons (labeled 1 and 2) and annotated forces, areas, and heights.
  • Left and center panels: "المكبان في مستويين مختلفين" ("Pistons at Different Levels").
  • Right panel: "المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي" ("Pistons at the Same Horizontal Level").

# Left Panel (Pistons at Different Levels, piston 1 higher) :
  • Piston 1 (left) at height h above piston 2 (right).
  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F to piston 2 (area A).
  • Fluid height difference h between pistons.
  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a = F/A + ρgh.

# Center Panel (Pistons at Different Levels, piston 2 higher) :
  • Piston 2 (right) at height h above piston 1 (left).
  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F to piston 2 (area A).
  • Fluid height difference h between pistons.
  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a + ρgh = F/A.

# Right Panel (Pistons at Same Level) :
  • Both pistons at the same horizontal level.
  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F to piston 2 (area A).
  • No height difference.
  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a = F/A.

# Symbols & Annotations :
  • f: force on small piston (area a).
  • F: force on large piston (area A).
  • h: height difference between pistons.
  • ρ: fluid density.
  • g: gravitational acceleration.
  • P₁, P₂: pressures at pistons 1 and 2.

# Analysis :
  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal (f/a = F/A).
  • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference due to fluid column (ρgh) must be included in the force-area relationship.
  • The direction of the height difference (which piston is higher) determines whether ρgh is added to or subtracted from the force-area ratio. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID a13db9f4-5481-4f85-9203-b54e32ab1820 -->
