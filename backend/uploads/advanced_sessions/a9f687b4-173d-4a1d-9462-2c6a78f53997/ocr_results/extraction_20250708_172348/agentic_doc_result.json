downward.\n  • Both pistons are shown pressing down on the liquid, with the liquid level equal in both arms.\n  • The diagram is labeled \"شكل ۲\" (Figure 2 in Persian/Arabic numerals).\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No scale bar or units are provided.\n  • The pistons are circular and fit tightly in their respective cylinders.\n  • The liquid is shown as a uniform blue fill, indicating an incompressible fluid.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The larger cylinder (left) and smaller cylinder (right) are connected at the base, allowing pressure transmission.\n  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.\n  • The forces F and f are applied vertically downward on the pistons.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The figure visually demonstrates Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.\n  • The system suggests that a small force on the small piston (right) can balance a larger force on the large piston (left) if the area ratio is appropriate (F/A = f/a).\n  • The equal liquid levels indicate static equilibrium, with pressures at the same horizontal level being equal. <!-- figure, from page 0

the relationship between force, area, and pressure when the pistons are at the same or different levels, with corresponding equations.\n\ndiagram:\n# Title & Layout :\n  • Title at top: \"حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار\" (\"States of the Hydraulic Piston at Equilibrium\").\n  • Three side-by-side panels, each showing a U-shaped hydraulic system with two pistons (labeled 1 and 2) and annotated forces, areas, and heights.\n  • Left and center panels: \"المكبان في مستويين مختلفين\" (\"Pistons at Different Levels\").\n  • Right panel: \"المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي\" (\"Pistons at the Same Horizontal Level\").\n\n# Left Panel (Pistons at Different Levels, piston 1 higher) :\n  • Piston 1 (left) at height h above piston 2 (right).\n  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F to piston 2 (area A).\n  • Fluid height difference h between pistons.\n  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a = F/A + ρgh.\n\n# Center Panel (Pistons at Different Levels, piston 2 higher) :\n  • Piston 2 (right) at height h above piston 1 (left).\n  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F to piston 2 (area A).\n  • Fluid height difference h between pistons.\n  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a + ρgh = F/A.\n\n# Right Panel (Pistons at Same Level) :\n  • Both pistons at the same horizontal level.\n  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F to piston 2 (area A).\n  • No height difference.\n  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a = F/A.\n\n# Symbols & Annotations :\n  • f: force on small piston (area a).\n  • F: force on large piston (area A).\n  • h: height difference between pistons.\n  • ρ: fluid density.\n  • g: gravitational acceleration.\n  • P₁, P₂: pressures at pistons 1 and 2.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal (f/a = F/A).\n  • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference due to fluid column (ρgh) must be included in the force-area relationship.\n  • The direction of the height difference (which piston is higher) determines whether ρgh is added to or subtracted from the force-area ratio. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID
