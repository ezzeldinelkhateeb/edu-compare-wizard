Summary : This is a labeled illustration and accompanying explanation of a hydraulic system demonstrating Pascal's principle, showing how force applied to a small piston is transmitted through a hydraulic fluid to a larger piston, resulting in a larger output force.

illustration:
# System Overview :
  • Two connected cylinders (left and right) filled with hydraulic fluid ("السائل الهيدروليكي").
  • Left cylinder has a large piston with area "A" and applied force "F".
  • Right cylinder has a small piston with area "a" and applied force "f".
  • Both pistons are at the same horizontal level (y₁ = y₂).
  • The system is labeled as "شكل 1".

# Labels & Notation :
  • "A" = area of large piston, "a" = area of small piston.
  • "F" = force on large piston, "f" = force on small piston.
  • "y₁", "y₂" = heights of fluid under each piston.
  • "P" = pressure, with equations P = f/a and P = F/A shown.

# Explanatory Text (Arabic) :
  • Describes that when both pistons are at the same level, applying force "f" to the small piston creates a pressure P = f/a.
  • This pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid to the large piston, resulting in an upward force "F" on the large piston, with P = F/A.
  • The explanation references Pascal's law and the transmission of pressure in incompressible fluids.

# Analysis :
  • The figure visually demonstrates Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The system allows a small input force on a small piston to generate a larger output force on a larger piston, proportional to the ratio of their areas.
  • The illustration and equations clarify the mechanical advantage provided by hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID c091bebb-6b10-4d78-a796-ccab83714bda -->

Summary : This illustration demonstrates a hydraulic system with two connected cylinders of different cross-sectional areas, each fitted with a piston and subjected to different applied forces.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The image shows two vertical cylinders connected at the base by a horizontal tube, forming a U-shaped container filled with liquid.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with piston area "A" and applied force "F" directed downward.
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area "a" and applied force "f" also directed downward.
  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.
  • The pistons are depicted as flat disks sealing the tops of the liquid columns.

Technical Details :
  • The left piston is labeled "A" (area) and "F" (force).
  • The right piston is labeled "a" (area) and "f" (force).
  • The liquid is shown as a continuous medium, with the interface at the same height in both cylinders.
  • The diagram is labeled "شكل ۲" (Figure 2) in Persian.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The larger cylinder is on the left, the smaller on the right.
  • Both pistons are at the same vertical level, indicating equal pressure at the interface.
  • The connecting tube allows fluid communication between the two sides.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually represents Pascal's principle, showing how a force applied to a larger area piston (F on A) can be balanced by a smaller force on a smaller area piston (f on a), as long as the pressure (F/A = f/a) is equalized.
  • The system is in static equilibrium, as indicated by the equal fluid levels. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.061,t=0.476,r=0.270,b=0.615), with ID d57ef142-510e-44e2-92c8-1f628e41107c -->

Summary : This figure illustrates the different equilibrium states of a hydraulic piston system, showing the relationship between force, area, and fluid pressure when the pistons are at the same or different heights. It provides the relevant equations for each scenario.

diagram:
# Title :
   • Title (top right): "حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار" ("Hydraulic piston states at equilibrium").
   • Subheading (center): "المكبسان في مستويين مختلفين" ("Pistons at different levels") and "المكبسان في نفس المستوى الأفقي" ("Pistons at the same horizontal level").

# Scenarios & Diagrams :
   ## Left Panel (Pistons at different levels, piston 1 higher):
     • Shows two pistons (A and a) with piston 1 at a higher level than piston 2.
     • Forces: f applied on piston a, F on piston A.
     • Height difference h between pistons.
     • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a = F/A + ρgh.

   ## Middle Panel (Pistons at different levels, piston 2 higher):
     • Similar setup, but piston 2 is higher than piston 1.
     • Forces: f on piston a, F on piston A.
     • Height difference h.
     • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a + ρgh = F/A.

   ## Right Panel (Pistons at same level):
     • Both pistons at the same horizontal level.
     • Forces: f on piston a, F on piston A.
     • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a = F/A.

# Equations :
   • For each scenario, the pressure equality and the relationship between force, area, and height difference (if any) are shown.
   • ρgh term appears only when pistons are at different heights.

# Visual Elements :
   • Each panel contains a U-shaped tube filled with fluid, pistons labeled 1 and 2, and arrows indicating applied forces.
   • Variables: f (small piston force), a (small piston area), F (large piston force), A (large piston area), h (height difference), ρ (fluid density), g (gravity).

# Analysis :
   • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal on both sides (f/a = F/A).
   • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference due to the fluid column (ρgh) must be considered, modifying the force-area relationship.
   • The direction of the ρgh term depends on which piston is higher, as shown in the left and middle panels. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID 00ab2272-5c62-45c8-8d63-189bfae10466 -->
