      "text": "Summary : This figure illustrates the different equilibrium states of a hydraulic piston system, showing the relationship between force, area, and fluid pressure when the pistons are at the same or different heights. It provides the relevant equations for each scenario.\n\ndiagram:\n# Title :\n   • Title (top right): \"حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار\" (\"Hydraulic piston states at equilibrium\").\n   • Subheading (center): \"المكبسان في مستويين مختلفين\" (\"Pistons at different levels\") and \"المكبسان في نفس المستوى الأفقي\" (\"Pistons at the same horizontal level\").\n\n# Scenarios & Diagrams :\n   ## Left Panel (Pistons at different levels, piston 1 higher):\n     • Shows two pistons (A and a) with piston 1 at a higher level than piston 2.\n     • Forces: f applied on piston a, F on piston A.\n     • Height difference h between pistons.\n     • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a = F/A + ρgh.\n\n   ## Middle Panel (Pistons at different levels, piston 2 higher):\n     • Similar setup, but piston 2 is higher than piston 1.\n     • Forces: f on piston a, F on piston A.\n     • Height difference h.\n     • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a + ρgh = F/A.\n\n   ## Right Panel (Pistons at same level):\n     • Both pistons at the same horizontal level.\n     • Forces: f on piston a, F on piston A.\n     • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a = F/A.\n\n# Equations :\n   • For each scenario, the pressure equality and the relationship between force, area, and height difference (if any) are shown.\n   • ρgh term appears only when pistons are at different heights.\n\n# Visual Elements :\n   • Each panel contains a U-shaped tube filled with fluid, pistons labeled 1 and 2, and arrows indicating applied forces.\n   • Variables: f (small piston force), a (small piston area), F (large piston force), A (large piston area), h (height difference), ρ (fluid density), g (gravity).\n\n# Analysis :\n   • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal on both sides (f/a = F/A).\n   • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference due to the fluid column (ρgh) must be considered, modifying the force-area relationship.\n   • The direction of the ρgh term depends on which piston is higher, as shown in the left and middle panels.",
