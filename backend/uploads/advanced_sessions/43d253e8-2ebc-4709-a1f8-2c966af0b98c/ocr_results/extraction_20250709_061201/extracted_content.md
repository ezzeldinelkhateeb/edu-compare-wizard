Summary : This is a labeled schematic illustration of a hydraulic fluid system, showing two pistons of different areas connected by a U-shaped tube filled with liquid, used to demonstrate Pascal's principle.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The diagram shows a U-shaped container filled with a liquid, labeled as "السانل الهيدروليكي" (hydraulic fluid).
  • On the left side, a large piston with area "A" is acted upon by a force "F" directed downward.
  • On the right side, a smaller piston with area "a" is acted upon by a force "f" directed downward.
  • The heights of the pistons above a reference level are marked as "y2" (left) and "y1" (right).
  • The pistons are shown as circular disks with vertical arrows indicating the direction of applied forces.

Technical Details :
  • The left piston (area A) is larger than the right piston (area a).
  • The forces F and f are applied vertically downward on the pistons.
  • The vertical distances y2 and y1 are marked with dashed lines, indicating the height of each piston above a common reference.
  • The system is labeled as "شكل (1)" (Figure 1).

Spatial Relationships :
  • The two pistons are connected by the same body of liquid, allowing pressure transmission between them.
  • The left piston is at a higher elevation than the right piston, as indicated by y2 > y1.
  • The pistons are positioned at the open ends of the U-tube.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually demonstrates the principle of hydraulic systems, where a force applied to a larger area piston (A) can be transmitted through an incompressible fluid to produce a different force on a smaller area piston (a), in accordance with Pascal's law.
  • The difference in heights (y2 and y1) may be used to analyze pressure differences or mechanical advantage in the system. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.064,t=0.061,r=0.415,b=0.252), with ID bd7b89ef-0fa3-44fc-9af9-f96c4f98c4fe -->

Summary : This illustration demonstrates Pascal's principle using a U-shaped hydraulic system with two pistons of different areas, showing how force applied to one piston is transmitted through an incompressible fluid to the other piston.

illustration:
System Overview :
  • U-shaped container filled with liquid, open at both ends.
  • Left side: large piston labeled "A" with area A and downward force F applied.
  • Right side: small piston labeled "a" with area a and downward force f applied.
  • Both pistons are at the same fluid level, indicating equilibrium.

Labels & Notation :
  • Left piston: "A" (area), "F" (force).
  • Right piston: "a" (area), "f" (force).
  • Dashed horizontal line marks equal fluid levels.
  • Caption in Persian: "(شکل ۲)" meaning "Figure 2".

Spatial Relationships :
  • The large piston (A) is wider and on the left; the small piston (a) is narrower and on the right.
  • Both pistons are shown pressing down on the liquid, with arrows indicating the direction of applied forces.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually represents the principle that pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid (Pascal's law).
  • The system suggests the relationship F/A = f/a, illustrating mechanical advantage in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.472,r=0.278,b=0.611), with ID 12b3e53b-9cb0-471a-9eb7-8af1a7524523 -->

Summary : This figure compares the pressure relationships and equations for two pistons in a U-tube hydraulic system, showing cases where the pistons are at different levels versus the same horizontal level.

illustration:
# Title & Layout :
  • Title (right): "المكبسـان في نفـس المسـتوى الأفقي" ("The pistons at the same horizontal level").
  • Title (left): "المكبسـان في مسـتويين مختلفين" ("The pistons at different levels").
  • Three side-by-side schematic diagrams, each with labeled pistons, forces, and fluid columns.
  • Each diagram is accompanied by pressure equations.

# Left Section (Pistons at Different Levels, Case 1) :
  • Shows a U-tube with piston 1 (area a, force f) at a lower level than piston 2 (area A, force F).
  • Fluid height difference h is marked.
  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
  • Equation: f/a = F/A + ρgh.

# Middle Section (Pistons at Different Levels, Case 2) :
  • Similar U-tube, but piston 1 is now at a higher level than piston 2.
  • Fluid height difference h is marked.
  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
  • Equation: f/a + ρgh = F/A.

# Right Section (Pistons at Same Level) :
  • U-tube with both pistons at the same horizontal level.
  • No height difference.
  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
  • Equation: f/a = F/A.

# Symbols & Notation :
  • f: Force applied on piston 1 (area a).
  • F: Force applied on piston 2 (area A).
  • ρ: Fluid density.
  • g: Acceleration due to gravity.
  • h: Height difference between fluid columns.

# Analysis :
  • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure equations include a ρgh term to account for the hydrostatic pressure difference.
  • When pistons are at the same level, the pressure relationship simplifies to a direct ratio of forces to areas.
  • The diagrams visually reinforce the effect of height difference on hydraulic pressure transmission. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.651,r=0.888,b=0.892), with ID 255a1aee-466e-4434-ba93-37a6ce8b56a1 -->
