Summary : This is a labeled illustration of a hydraulic fluid system, showing two pistons of different areas connected by a U-shaped tube filled with liquid, used to demonstrate Pascal's principle.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The diagram shows a U-shaped container filled with a hydraulic fluid.
  • On the left side, a large piston with area labeled "A" and force "F" is applied downward.
  • On the right side, a smaller piston with area "a" and force "f" is applied downward.
  • The heights of the fluid columns under each piston are labeled as y₂ (left) and y₁ (right).
  • The system is labeled as "السانل الهيدروليكي" (the hydraulic fluid).
  • The figure is labeled as "شكل (1)" (Figure 1).

Technical Details :
  • The left piston is larger in diameter than the right piston.
  • Both pistons are shown pressing down on the fluid, with arrows indicating the direction of applied forces.
  • The fluid levels are at different heights under each piston, with vertical distances y₂ and y₁ marked.
  • The illustration is part of "الدرس الخامس" (Lesson Five).

Spatial Relationships :
  • The left piston (A, F) is at a higher fluid level than the right piston (a, f).
  • The U-tube connects the two pistons, allowing pressure transmission between them.
  • The difference in piston areas and fluid heights visually demonstrates the principle of force multiplication in hydraulic systems.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains how a small force applied to a small-area piston can be transformed into a larger force on a larger-area piston, as per Pascal's principle.
  • The difference in fluid heights and piston areas highlights the inverse relationship between force and area in hydraulic systems.
  • The diagram is suitable for teaching the basic operation and principle of hydraulic lifts or presses. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.064,t=0.061,r=0.415,b=0.252), with ID a5e17bb5-b2ef-4c1f-b8e8-39aba9f150c6 -->

Summary : This illustration demonstrates the principle of hydraulic systems, showing how a force applied to a larger piston (A) is transmitted through an incompressible fluid to a smaller piston (a), resulting in a different force output.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The image shows a U-shaped container filled with liquid, with two vertical cylinders attached at each end.
  • The left cylinder is wider and labeled "A" with a piston on top, upon which a downward force "F" is applied.
  • The right cylinder is narrower and labeled "a" with a piston on top, upon which a downward force "f" is applied.
  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.
  • The diagram is labeled "شكل ۲" (Figure 2 in Persian/Arabic numerals).

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or units are provided.
  • The pistons are depicted as flat disks fitting tightly in their respective cylinders.
  • The forces "F" and "f" are shown as arrows pointing downward on the pistons.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The left piston (A) is much larger in area than the right piston (a).
  • The liquid connects both pistons, allowing force transmission.
  • The dashed line indicates equal liquid levels, signifying pressure balance.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The difference in piston areas (A > a) suggests that a small force "f" on the small piston can balance a much larger force "F" on the large piston, or vice versa, depending on the direction of force application.
  • This setup is foundational for understanding hydraulic lifts and presses. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.472,r=0.278,b=0.611), with ID 865a84de-6e2b-475f-a642-d4d06f68c08c -->

Summary : This figure compares the pressure relationships in hydraulic systems with pistons at different levels, illustrating the effect of height difference on pressure transmission and the resulting equations.

illustration:
# Pistons at Different Levels :
• The left and center panels show two pistons (1 and 2) in a U-shaped tube containing fluid, with piston 1 at a lower level than piston 2.
• Both panels indicate an applied force f on piston 1 (area a) and a force F on piston 2 (area A).
• The height difference between the pistons is labeled h.
• The pressure at each piston is denoted as P₁ and P₂.
• The pressure equality is written as P₁ = P₂.
• The pressure equation is given as: f/a = F/A + ρgh, where ρ is fluid density and g is gravitational acceleration.

# Pistons at the Same Level :
• The right panel shows both pistons at the same horizontal level in the fluid.
• Forces f and F are applied to pistons 1 and 2, respectively.
• The pressure equality is P₁ = P₂.
• The pressure equation simplifies to: f/a = F/A.

# Equations and Annotations :
• The equations are shown below each diagram, with the additional ρgh term present only when the pistons are at different heights.
• Arabic text labels the scenarios: "المكبسـان في مستويين مختلفين" (pistons at different levels) and "المكبسـان في نفس المستوي الأفقي" (pistons at the same horizontal level).

Analysis :
• The figure visually demonstrates that when pistons are at different heights, the pressure transmission includes a hydrostatic term (ρgh), while at the same level, the pressure is transmitted directly according to the ratio of forces to areas.
• This highlights the importance of height differences in hydraulic systems and the application of Pascal's principle. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.651,r=0.888,b=0.892), with ID eedeec69-002b-43df-8e39-ee0b0bbf00e3 -->
