Summary : This is a labeled illustration of a hydraulic fluid system, showing two pistons of different areas connected by a U-shaped tube filled with liquid, used to demonstrate the principles of hydraulic pressure and force transmission.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The diagram shows a U-shaped container filled with a liquid labeled "السانل الهيدروليكي" (hydraulic fluid).
  • On the left side, a large piston with area "A" is acted upon by an upward force "F".
  • On the right side, a smaller piston with area "a" is acted upon by a downward force "f".
  • The heights of the pistons above a reference level are marked as "y2" (left) and "y1" (right).
  • The system is labeled as "شكل (1)" (Figure 1).
  • The image is from "الدرس الخامس" (Lesson 5).

Technical Details :
  • The pistons are shown as circular disks fitting tightly in the vertical arms of the U-tube.
  • The liquid level is continuous between the two arms, indicating pressure transmission.
  • Forces and areas are clearly labeled: "F" and "A" (left), "f" and "a" (right).
  • Vertical distances "y2" and "y1" are marked with dashed lines.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The left piston (larger area) is higher than the right piston (smaller area).
  • The forces act in opposite directions: upward on the left, downward on the right.
  • The system visually demonstrates the principle that pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains Pascal's principle in hydraulics, showing how a small force applied to a small-area piston can balance a larger force on a larger-area piston, depending on the relative areas and heights.
  • The labeled heights suggest the importance of potential energy and pressure differences in the system. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.064,t=0.061,r=0.415,b=0.252), with ID a101036b-e392-4596-a6b5-3a7aae308702 -->

Summary : This illustration demonstrates the principle of hydraulic systems, showing how a force applied to a large piston is transmitted through an incompressible fluid to a smaller piston, resulting in a different force output.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The image shows a U-shaped container filled with liquid, with two vertical cylinders of different diameters attached to each end.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled "A" (area) with a piston on top, and a downward force "F" applied.
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled "a" (area) with a piston on top, and a downward force "f" applied.
  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.
  • The diagram is labeled in Persian as "شکل ۲" (Figure 2).

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or units are provided.
  • Forces are denoted by "F" (large piston) and "f" (small piston).
  • Areas are denoted by "A" (large piston) and "a" (small piston).
  • The pistons are shown as solid disks fitting tightly in the cylinders.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The large piston (left) and small piston (right) are connected by the liquid in the U-tube.
  • The pistons are at the same vertical height, indicating balanced pressures.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The system demonstrates how a small force applied to a small area can balance a larger force applied to a larger area, or vice versa, depending on the ratio of areas (F/A = f/a).
  • This is the fundamental concept behind hydraulic lifts and presses. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.472,r=0.278,b=0.611), with ID 6e54bb07-1225-4305-9dab-2a81a1437fbc -->

Summary : This figure compares the pressure relationships and force equations for two pistons in a U-tube hydraulic system, considering cases where the pistons are at different and the same horizontal levels.

illustration:
# Left and Middle Panels: Pistons at Different Levels :
  • Both panels show a U-tube filled with liquid, with two pistons (labeled 1 and 2) of different cross-sectional areas (a and A) placed on each arm.
  • The left panel shows piston 1 lower than piston 2; the middle panel shows piston 1 higher than piston 2.
  • Forces f and F are applied to pistons 1 and 2, respectively.
  • The height difference between the pistons is denoted as h.
  • The pressure equality is stated as P₁ = P₂.
  • The force relationship is given as:  
    f/a = F/A + ρgh (left panel)  
    f/a + ρgh = F/A (middle panel)

# Right Panel: Pistons at the Same Level :
  • Both pistons are at the same horizontal level in the U-tube.
  • Forces f and F are applied to pistons 1 and 2, respectively.
  • The pressure equality is stated as P₁ = P₂.
  • The force relationship is given as:  
    f/a = F/A

# Headings and Annotations :
  • Top left and middle: "المكبسـان في مستويين مختلفين" (The pistons at different levels)
  • Top right: "المكبسـان في نفس المستـوى الأفقي" (The pistons at the same horizontal level)
  • Variables: f (force on small piston), F (force on large piston), a (area of small piston), A (area of large piston), h (height difference), ρ (liquid density), g (acceleration due to gravity).

# Analysis :
  • When the pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference due to the liquid column (ρgh) must be included in the force balance.
  • When the pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal for both pistons, illustrating Pascal's principle in its simplest form.
  • The figure visually and mathematically demonstrates how hydraulic systems transmit force and how height differences affect the required input force. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.651,r=0.888,b=0.892), with ID be86923f-49e3-4ec4-92ad-ca8dc879a1bb -->
