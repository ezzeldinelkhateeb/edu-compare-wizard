incompressible fluid to a smaller piston (a), resulting in a different force output.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • The image shows a U-shaped container filled with liquid, with two vertical cylinders attached at each end.\n  • The left cylinder is wider and labeled \"A\" with a piston on top, upon which a downward force \"F\" is applied.\n  • The right cylinder is narrower and labeled \"a\" with a piston on top, upon which a downward force \"f\" is applied.\n  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.\n  • The diagram is labeled \"شكل ۲\" (Figure 2 in Persian/Arabic numerals).\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No scale bar or units are provided.\n  • The pistons are depicted as flat disks fitting tightly in their respective cylinders.\n  • The forces \"F\" and \"f\" are shown as arrows pointing downward on the pistons.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The left piston (A) is much larger in area than the right piston (a).\n  • The liquid connects both pistons, allowing force transmission.\n  • The dashed line indicates equal liquid levels, signifying pressure balance.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The figure visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.\n  • The difference in piston areas (A > a) suggests that a small force \"f\" on the small piston can balance a much larger force \"F\" on the large piston, or vice versa, depending on the direction of force application.\n  • This setup is foundational for understanding hydraulic lifts and presses. <!-- figure, from

illustrating the effect of height difference on pressure transmission and the resulting equations.\n\nillustration:\n# Pistons at Different Levels :\n• The left and center panels show two pistons (1 and 2) in a U-shaped tube containing fluid, with piston 1 at a lower level than piston 2.\n• Both panels indicate an applied force f on piston 1 (area a) and a force F on piston 2 (area A).\n• The height difference between the pistons is labeled h.\n• The pressure at each piston is denoted as P₁ and P₂.\n• The pressure equality is written as P₁ = P₂.\n• The pressure equation is given as: f/a = F/A + ρgh, where ρ is fluid density and g is gravitational acceleration.\n\n# Pistons at the Same Level :\n• The right panel shows both pistons at the same horizontal level in the fluid.\n• Forces f and F are applied to pistons 1 and 2, respectively.\n• The pressure equality is P₁ = P₂.\n• The pressure equation simplifies to: f/a = F/A.\n\n# Equations and Annotations :\n• The equations are shown below each diagram, with the additional ρgh term present only when the pistons are at different heights.\n• Arabic text labels the scenarios: \"المكبسـان في مستويين مختلفين\" (pistons at different levels) and \"المكبسـان في نفس المستوي الأفقي\" (pistons at the same horizontal level).\n\nAnalysis :\n• The figure visually demonstrates that when pistons are at different heights, the pressure transmission includes a hydrostatic term (ρgh), while at the same level, the pressure is transmitted directly according to the ratio of forces to areas.\n• This highlights the importance of height differences in hydraulic systems and the application of Pascal's principle. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.651,r=0.888,b=0.892), with ID eedeec69-002b-43df-8e39-ee0b0bbf00e3 -->\n\nحيث : (p)

(labeled 1 and 2) of different cross-sectional areas (a and A) placed on each arm.\n  • The left panel shows piston 1 lower than piston 2; the middle panel shows piston 1 higher than piston 2.\n  • Forces f and F are applied to pistons 1 and 2, respectively.\n  • The height difference between the pistons is denoted as h.\n  • The pressure equality is stated as P₁ = P₂.\n  • The force relationship is given as:  \n    f/a = F/A + ρgh (left panel)  \n    f/a + ρgh = F/A (middle panel)\n\n# Right Panel: Pistons at the Same Level :\n  • Both pistons are at the same horizontal level in the U-tube.\n  • Forces f and F are applied to pistons 1 and 2, respectively.\n  • The pressure equality is stated as P₁ = P₂.\n  • The force relationship is given as:  \n    f/a = F/A\n\n# Headings and Annotations :\n  • Top left and middle: \"المكبسـان في مستويين مختلفين\" (The pistons at different levels)\n  • Top right: \"المكبسـان في نفس المستـوى الأفقي\" (The pistons at the same horizontal level)\n  • Variables: f (force on small piston), F (force on large piston), a (area of small piston), A (area of large piston), h (height difference), ρ (liquid density), g (acceleration due to gravity).\n\n# Analysis :\n  • When the pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference due to the liquid column (ρgh) must be included in the force balance.\n  • When the pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal for both pistons, illustrating Pascal's principle in its simplest form.\n  • The figure visually and mathematically demonstrates how hydraulic systems transmit force and how height differences affect the required input force. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.651,r=0.888,b=0.892), with ID be86923f-49e3-4ec4-92ad-ca8dc879a1bb -->\n\nحيث : (p)
