different force output.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • The image shows two vertical cylinders of different diameters connected at the base by a U-shaped tube filled with liquid.\n  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with piston area \"A\" and force \"F\" applied downward.\n  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area \"a\" and force \"f\" applied downward.\n  • Both pistons are shown pressing down on the liquid, with the liquid level equal in both cylinders.\n  • The diagram is labeled \"شكل ۲\" (Figure 2 in Persian/Arabic numerals).\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No scale bar or units are provided.\n  • The pistons are depicted as flat, circular disks.\n  • The liquid is shown as a uniform blue fill, indicating an incompressible fluid.\n  • The forces (F and f) are indicated by downward arrows.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The larger piston (A) is on the left, the smaller piston (a) is on the right.\n  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.\n  • The connecting tube at the base allows pressure transmission between the two cylinders.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.\n  • The force applied to the larger piston (F) is distributed over a larger area (A), while the force on the smaller piston (f) acts over a smaller area (a), demonstrating how hydraulic systems can amplify force or motion depending on piston areas.\n  • The equal liquid levels indicate that the system is in static equilibrium. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.061,t=0.476,r=0.270,b=0.615), with ID 35cf30c0-6c25-4828-896b-61f62cd7e6d8 -->\n\n- لكي يعود الكبسان في مستوى أفقي واحد كما في الشكل (2) يجب التأثير على

states of a hydraulic piston system, showing the relationship between force, area, and pressure when the pistons are at the same or different levels, with corresponding equations.\n\ndiagram:\n# Title & Layout :\n  • Title (top right): \"حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار\" (\"Hydraulic piston states at equilibrium\").\n  • Three side-by-side panels, each showing a U-shaped hydraulic system with two pistons (labeled 1 and 2) and annotated forces, areas, and heights.\n  • Left and center panels: \"المكبان في مستويين مختلفين\" (\"Pistons at different levels\").\n  • Right panel: \"المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي\" (\"Pistons at the same horizontal level\").\n\n# Left Panel (Pistons at Different Levels, piston 1 higher) :\n  • Piston 1 (left) at height h above piston 2 (right).\n  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F to piston 2 (area A).\n  • Fluid height difference h between pistons.\n  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n  • Equation: f/a = F/A + ρgh.\n\n# Center Panel (Pistons at Different Levels, piston 2 higher) :\n  • Piston 2 (right) at height h above piston 1 (left).\n  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F to piston 2 (area A).\n  • Fluid height difference h (opposite direction).\n  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n  • Equation: f/a + ρgh = F/A.\n\n# Right Panel (Pistons at Same Level) :\n  • Both pistons at the same horizontal level.\n  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F to piston 2 (area A).\n  • No height difference.\n  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n  • Equation: f/a = F/A.\n\n# Symbols & Notation :\n  • f: force on small piston (area a).\n  • F: force on large piston (area A).\n  • h: height difference between pistons.\n  • ρ: fluid density.\n  • g: gravitational acceleration.\n  • P₁, P₂: pressures at pistons 1 and 2.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal on both sides (f/a = F/A).\n  • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference due to fluid column (ρgh) must be included, either added or subtracted depending on which piston is higher.\n  • The equations visually reinforce Pascal’s principle and the effect of hydrostatic pressure in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID 7fa41d84-ccea-4943-b0c4-c98241076efd -->\n\nحيث : (ρ) كثافة السائل ، (h) ارتفاع عمود
