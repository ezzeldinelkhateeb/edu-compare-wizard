Summary : This is a labeled illustration and accompanying explanation of a hydraulic system demonstrating Pascal's principle, showing how force applied to a small piston is transmitted through a fluid to a larger piston, resulting in a larger output force.

illustration:
# System Overview :
  • Two connected cylinders (left and right) filled with hydraulic fluid ("السائل الهيدروليكي").
  • Left cylinder has a large piston (area A, force F, displacement y1).
  • Right cylinder has a small piston (area a, force f, displacement y2).
  • Both pistons are at the same horizontal level.

# Labels & Notation :
  • Left piston: area A, force F, displacement y1.
  • Right piston: area a, force f, displacement y2.
  • Fluid is labeled as "السائل الهيدروليكي".
  • Arrows indicate direction of applied forces (downward on right, upward on left).

# Mathematical Relationships :
  • Pressure under small piston: P = f / a.
  • Pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid.
  • Force on large piston: F = P × A, so P = F / A.

# Explanatory Text (Arabic) :
  • Describes the process: when the pistons are level and a force f is applied to the small piston, it creates a pressure P = f / a.
  • This pressure is transmitted through the fluid to the large piston, resulting in an upward force F.
  • The relationship P = F / A is given for the large piston.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The system amplifies force: a small force on a small piston produces a larger force on a larger piston, proportional to the area ratio.
  • The diagram and equations together clarify the mechanical advantage of hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID 5a5c20a9-edd1-465e-89e0-9e93d981f1c9 -->

Summary : This illustration demonstrates the principle of hydraulic systems, showing how a force applied to a larger piston is transmitted through a fluid to a smaller piston, resulting in a different force output.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The image shows two vertical cylinders of different diameters connected at the base by a U-shaped tube filled with liquid.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with piston area "A" and force "F" applied downward.
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area "a" and force "f" applied downward.
  • Both pistons are shown pressing down on the liquid, with the liquid level equal in both cylinders.
  • The diagram is labeled "شكل ۲" (Figure 2 in Persian/Arabic numerals).

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or units are provided.
  • The pistons are depicted as flat, circular disks.
  • The liquid is shown as a uniform blue fill, indicating an incompressible fluid.
  • The forces (F and f) are indicated by downward arrows.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The larger piston (A) is on the left, the smaller piston (a) is on the right.
  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.
  • The connecting tube at the base allows pressure transmission between the two cylinders.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The force applied to the larger piston (F) is distributed over a larger area (A), while the force on the smaller piston (f) acts over a smaller area (a), demonstrating how hydraulic systems can amplify force or motion depending on piston areas.
  • The equal liquid levels indicate that the system is in static equilibrium. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.061,t=0.476,r=0.270,b=0.615), with ID 35cf30c0-6c25-4828-896b-61f62cd7e6d8 -->

# Title & Layout :
  • Title (top right): "حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار" ("Hydraulic piston states at equilibrium").
  • Three side-by-side panels, each showing a U-shaped hydraulic system with two pistons (labeled 1 and 2) and annotated forces, areas, and heights.
  • Left and center panels: "المكبان في مستويين مختلفين" ("Pistons at different levels").
  • Right panel: "المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي" ("Pistons at the same horizontal level").

# Left Panel (Pistons at Different Levels, piston 1 higher) :
  • Piston 1 (left) at height h above piston 2 (right).
  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F to piston 2 (area A).
  • Fluid height difference h between pistons.
  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
  • Equation: f/a = F/A + ρgh.

# Center Panel (Pistons at Different Levels, piston 2 higher) :
  • Piston 2 (right) at height h above piston 1 (left).
  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F to piston 2 (area A).
  • Fluid height difference h (opposite direction).
  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
  • Equation: f/a + ρgh = F/A.

# Right Panel (Pistons at Same Level) :
  • Both pistons at the same horizontal level.
  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F to piston 2 (area A).
  • No height difference.
  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
  • Equation: f/a = F/A.

# Symbols & Notation :
  • f: force on small piston (area a).
  • F: force on large piston (area A).
  • h: height difference between pistons.
  • ρ: fluid density.
  • g: gravitational acceleration.
  • P₁, P₂: pressures at pistons 1 and 2.

# Analysis :
  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal on both sides (f/a = F/A).
  • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference due to fluid column (ρgh) must be included, either added or subtracted depending on which piston is higher.
  • The equations visually reinforce Pascal’s principle and the effect of hydrostatic pressure in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID 7fa41d84-ccea-4943-b0c4-c98241076efd -->
