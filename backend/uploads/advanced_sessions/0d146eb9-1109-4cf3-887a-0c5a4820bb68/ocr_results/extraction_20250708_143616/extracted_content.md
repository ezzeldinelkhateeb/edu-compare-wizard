Summary : This is a labeled illustration of a hydraulic fluid system, showing two connected cylinders of different cross-sectional areas and pistons, used to demonstrate Pascal's principle.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The diagram shows two vertical cylinders connected at the base, both filled with a hydraulic fluid.
  • The left cylinder has a large piston (area labeled A) with an upward force F applied.
  • The right cylinder has a smaller piston (area labeled a) with a downward force f applied.
  • The fluid levels in both cylinders are marked, with vertical distances y₁ and y₂ indicated between the pistons and the fluid surface.
  • The system is labeled in Arabic as "السانل الهيدروليكي" (the hydraulic fluid).

Technical Details :
  • The pistons are shown as solid disks fitting tightly in their respective cylinders.
  • Forces are indicated by arrows: F (upward on the large piston), f (downward on the small piston).
  • The cross-sectional areas of the pistons are labeled as A (large) and a (small).
  • The vertical distances y₁ and y₂ are marked between the pistons and the fluid surface.
  • The illustration is labeled as "شكل (1)" (Figure 1).

Spatial Relationships :
  • The large piston (left) is at a lower height than the small piston (right).
  • The two cylinders are connected at the base, allowing fluid to transmit pressure between them.
  • The forces and areas are visually contrasted to illustrate the mechanical advantage in a hydraulic system.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually demonstrates Pascal's principle: a force applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The difference in piston areas (A > a) and the corresponding forces (F > f) suggest the system can multiply force, a key feature of hydraulic devices.
  • The labeled distances y₁ and y₂ may be used to discuss work or energy transfer in the system. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.064,t=0.061,r=0.415,b=0.252), with ID 75af64d1-4c5d-4e9f-ade5-7c0d174d791c -->

Summary : This illustration demonstrates the principle of hydraulic systems, showing how a force applied to a large piston is transmitted through a fluid to a smaller piston, resulting in a different force output.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The image shows a U-shaped container filled with liquid, with two vertical cylinders of different diameters attached to each end.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled "A" (area) with a piston on top, and a downward force "F" applied.
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled "a" (area) with a piston on top, and a downward force "f" applied.
  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.
  • The diagram is labeled in Persian as "شکل ۲" (Figure 2).

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or units are provided.
  • Forces are indicated by arrows and labeled "F" (left, large piston) and "f" (right, small piston).
  • Areas of pistons are labeled "A" (left) and "a" (right).

Spatial Relationships :
  • The large piston (left) and small piston (right) are connected by the same fluid, illustrating pressure transmission.
  • The pistons are at the same vertical height, showing equal fluid pressure at that level.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The setup suggests that the ratio of forces to areas (F/A = f/a) is key to hydraulic multiplication.
  • The image is likely used to teach the mechanical advantage of hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.472,r=0.278,b=0.611), with ID 364ff85a-9172-4af1-aabb-475b2561be06 -->

Summary : This figure compares the pressure relationships in hydraulic systems with pistons at different levels, illustrating the effect of height difference on pressure transmission and the resulting equations.

illustration:
# Left Panel: Pistons at Different Levels (Piston 2 Higher)
  • Shows a U-shaped tube with two pistons: piston 1 (area a, force f) at a lower level, piston 2 (area A, force F) at a higher level (height difference h).
  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, leading to f/a = F/A + ρgh.
  • Indicates that the pressure at piston 1 must overcome both the pressure at piston 2 and the hydrostatic pressure due to the height difference.

# Middle Panel: Pistons at Different Levels (Piston 2 Lower)
  • Similar U-tube, but piston 2 is now at a lower level than piston 1 (height difference h).
  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, leading to f/a + ρgh = F/A.
  • Shows that the pressure at piston 1 is increased by the hydrostatic pressure from the height difference.

# Right Panel: Pistons at the Same Level
  • U-tube with both pistons at the same horizontal level.
  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, leading to f/a = F/A.
  • No hydrostatic pressure term since there is no height difference.

# Equations :
  • f/a = F/A + ρgh (when piston 2 is higher)
  • f/a + ρgh = F/A (when piston 2 is lower)
  • f/a = F/A (when pistons are at the same level)

# Labels & Notation :
  • f: force applied on piston 1 (area a)
  • F: force applied on piston 2 (area A)
  • h: height difference between pistons
  • ρ: fluid density
  • g: gravitational acceleration

# Analysis :
  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at different heights, the pressure relationship must account for the hydrostatic pressure due to the fluid column (ρgh).
  • When pistons are at the same level, the pressure is transmitted equally (Pascal’s principle), and the force-to-area ratio is equal on both sides.
  • The equations visually reinforce the importance of height difference in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.651,r=0.888,b=0.892), with ID 4f820ad9-0379-424e-a064-ccfdd4f4c682 -->
