principle.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • The diagram shows two vertical cylinders connected at the base, both filled with a hydraulic fluid.\n  • The left cylinder has a large piston (area labeled A) with an upward force F applied.\n  • The right cylinder has a smaller piston (area labeled a) with a downward force f applied.\n  • The fluid levels in both cylinders are marked, with vertical distances y₁ and y₂ indicated between the pistons and the fluid surface.\n  • The system is labeled in Arabic as \"السانل الهيدروليكي\" (the hydraulic fluid).\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • The pistons are shown as solid disks fitting tightly in their respective cylinders.\n  • Forces are indicated by arrows: F (upward on the large piston), f (downward on the small piston).\n  • The cross-sectional areas of the pistons are labeled as A (large) and a (small).\n  • The vertical distances y₁ and y₂ are marked between the pistons and the fluid surface.\n  • The illustration is labeled as \"شكل (1)\" (Figure 1).\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The large piston (left) is at a lower height than the small piston (right).\n  • The two cylinders are connected at the base, allowing fluid to transmit pressure between them.\n  • The forces and areas are visually contrasted to illustrate the mechanical advantage in a hydraulic system.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration visually demonstrates Pascal's principle: a force applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.\n  • The difference in piston areas (A > a) and the corresponding forces (F > f) suggest the system can multiply force, a key feature of hydraulic devices.\n  • The labeled distances y₁ and y₂ may be used to discuss work or energy transfer in the system. <!-- figure, from

difference on pressure transmission and the resulting equations.\n\nillustration:\n# Left Panel: Pistons at Different Levels (Piston 2 Higher)\n  • Shows a U-shaped tube with two pistons: piston 1 (area a, force f) at a lower level, piston 2 (area A, force F) at a higher level (height difference h).\n  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, leading to f/a = F/A + ρgh.\n  • Indicates that the pressure at piston 1 must overcome both the pressure at piston 2 and the hydrostatic pressure due to the height difference.\n\n# Middle Panel: Pistons at Different Levels (Piston 2 Lower)\n  • Similar U-tube, but piston 2 is now at a lower level than piston 1 (height difference h).\n  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, leading to f/a + ρgh = F/A.\n  • Shows that the pressure at piston 1 is increased by the hydrostatic pressure from the height difference.\n\n# Right Panel: Pistons at the Same Level\n  • U-tube with both pistons at the same horizontal level.\n  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, leading to f/a = F/A.\n  • No hydrostatic pressure term since there is no height difference.\n\n# Equations :\n  • f/a = F/A + ρgh (when piston 2 is higher)\n  • f/a + ρgh = F/A (when piston 2 is lower)\n  • f/a = F/A (when pistons are at the same level)\n\n# Labels & Notation :\n  • f: force applied on piston 1 (area a)\n  • F: force applied on piston 2 (area A)\n  • h: height difference between pistons\n  • ρ: fluid density\n  • g: gravitational acceleration\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at different heights, the pressure relationship must account for the hydrostatic pressure due to the fluid column (ρgh).\n  • When pistons are at the same level, the pressure is transmitted equally (Pascal’s principle), and the force-to-area ratio is equal on both sides.\n  • The equations visually reinforce the importance of height difference in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.651,r=0.888,b=0.892), with ID 4f820ad9-0379-424e-a064-ccfdd4f4c682 -->\n\nحيث : (ρ) كثافة
