difference on pressure transmission and the resulting equations.\n\nillustration:\n# Left Panel: Pistons at Different Levels (Piston 2 Higher)\n  • Shows a U-shaped tube with two pistons: piston 1 (area a, force f) at a lower level, piston 2 (area A, force F) at a higher level (height difference h).\n  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, leading to f/a = F/A + ρgh.\n  • Indicates that the pressure at piston 1 must overcome both the pressure at piston 2 and the hydrostatic pressure due to the height difference.\n\n# Middle Panel: Pistons at Different Levels (Piston 2 Lower)\n  • Similar U-tube, but piston 2 is now at a lower level than piston 1 (height difference h).\n  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, leading to f/a + ρgh = F/A.\n  • Shows that the pressure at piston 1 is increased by the hydrostatic pressure from the height difference.\n\n# Right Panel: Pistons at the Same Level\n  • U-tube with both pistons at the same horizontal level.\n  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, leading to f/a = F/A.\n  • No hydrostatic pressure term since there is no height difference.\n\n# Equations :\n  • f/a = F/A + ρgh (when piston 2 is higher)\n  • f/a + ρgh = F/A (when piston 2 is lower)\n  • f/a = F/A (when pistons are at the same level)\n\n# Labels & Notation :\n  • f: force applied on piston 1 (area a)\n  • F: force applied on piston 2 (area A)\n  • h: height difference between pistons\n  • ρ: fluid density\n  • g: gravitational acceleration\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at different heights, the pressure relationship must account for the hydrostatic pressure due to the fluid column (ρgh).\n  • When pistons are at the same level, the pressure is transmitted equally (Pascal’s principle), and the force-to-area ratio is equal on both sides.\n  • The equations visually reinforce the importance of height difference in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.651,r=0.888,b=0.892), with ID 4f820ad9-0379-424e-a064-ccfdd4f4c682 -->\n\nحيث : (ρ) كثافة

الكبب الكبير بقوة F لأسفل. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.313,t=0.549,r=0.837,b=0.598), with ID 31ddc790-3b00-4328-aa48-ab814b9b3031 -->\n\nSummary : This figure illustrates the different equilibrium states of a hydraulic piston system, showing the relationship between force, area, and pressure when the pistons are at the same or different levels, with corresponding equations.\n\ndiagram:\n# Title & Layout :\n  • Title (top right): \"حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار\" (\"Hydraulic piston states at equilibrium\").\n  • Three side-by-side panels, each showing a U-shaped hydraulic system with two pistons (labeled 1 and 2) and annotated forces, areas, and heights.\n  • Left and center panels: \"المكبان في مستويين مختلفين\" (\"Pistons at different levels\").\n  • Right panel: \"المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي\" (\"Pistons at the same horizontal level\").\n\n# Left Panel (Pistons at Different Levels, piston 1 higher) :\n  • Piston 1 (left) at height h above piston 2 (right).\n  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F to piston 2 (area A).\n  • Fluid height difference h between pistons.\n  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n  • Equation: f/a = F/A + ρgh.\n\n# Center Panel (Pistons at Different Levels, piston 2 higher) :\n  • Piston 2 (right) at height h above piston 1 (left).\n  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F to piston 2 (area A).\n  • Fluid height difference h (opposite direction).\n  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n  • Equation: f/a + ρgh = F/A.\n\n# Right Panel (Pistons at Same Level) :\n  • Both pistons at the same horizontal level.\n  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F to piston 2 (area A).\n  • No height difference.\n  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n  • Equation: f/a = F/A.\n\n# Symbols & Notation :\n  • f: force on small piston (area a).\n  • F: force on large piston (area A).\n  • h: height difference between pistons.\n  • ρ: fluid density.\n  • g: gravitational acceleration.\n  • P₁, P₂: pressures at pistons 1 and 2.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal on both sides (f/a = F/A).\n  • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference due to fluid column (ρgh) must be included, either added or subtracted depending on which piston is higher.\n  • The equations visually reinforce Pascal’s principle and the effect of hydrostatic pressure in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID 7fa41d84-ccea-4943-b0c4-c98241076efd -->\n\nحيث : (ρ) كثافة السائل ، (h) ارتفاع عمود
