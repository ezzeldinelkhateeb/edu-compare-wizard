Summary : This is a labeled illustration and accompanying explanation of the operation of a hydraulic press, showing how force and pressure are transmitted through a hydraulic fluid between two pistons of different areas.

illustration:
# Diagram Overview :
  • The diagram shows two connected cylinders (left and right) filled with hydraulic fluid (labeled "السائل الهيدروليكي").
  • The left cylinder contains a large piston with area "A" and force "F" applied downward.
  • The right cylinder contains a smaller piston with area "a" and force "f" applied downward.
  • Both pistons are at the same horizontal level, with vertical distances y₁ and y₂ marked.
  • The system is labeled as "شكل (1)".

# Annotations & Labels :
  • Left piston: area "A", force "F", vertical distance "y₁".
  • Right piston: area "a", force "f", vertical distance "y₂".
  • Both pistons are shown pressing down on the hydraulic fluid.
  • The fluid is labeled "السائل الهيدروليكي" (hydraulic fluid).

# Accompanying Text (Key Points) :
  • When the two pistons are at the same horizontal level and a force "f" is applied to the small piston, a pressure "P" is produced at the bottom of the small piston: P = f / a.
  • This pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid and to the bottom of the large piston, resulting in an upward force "F" on the large piston: P = F / A.
  • The explanation references Pascal's principle and the transmission of pressure in fluids.

# Equations :
  • P = f / a (pressure under the small piston)
  • P = F / A (pressure under the large piston)

Analysis :
  • The illustration and text together explain how a small force applied to a small-area piston can generate a much larger force on a large-area piston via hydraulic pressure, demonstrating the principle of the hydraulic press. The pressure is constant throughout the fluid, allowing force multiplication based on the ratio of piston areas. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID 0cddc843-b0bf-42cf-b9fc-ca2f575a95b4 -->

Summary : This illustration shows a U-shaped hydraulic system with two pistons of different areas, each subjected to a downward force, demonstrating the principle of hydraulic pressure transmission.

illustration:
System Overview :
  • Two vertical cylinders connected at the base by a U-shaped tube, both filled with liquid.
  • Left cylinder: larger piston labeled "A" with area A, force F applied downward.
  • Right cylinder: smaller piston labeled "a" with area a, force f applied downward.
  • Liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.

Labels & Notation :
  • Left piston: area "A", force "F".
  • Right piston: area "a", force "f".
  • Dashed line marks the equal liquid level.
  • Persian text at the bottom: "شکل ۲" (Figure 2).

Spatial Relationships :
  • Larger piston and cylinder on the left, smaller on the right.
  • Both pistons are at the same vertical height relative to the liquid surface.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually demonstrates Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The system suggests that the ratio of forces to areas (F/A = f/a) is equal, illustrating mechanical advantage in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.061,t=0.476,r=0.270,b=0.615), with ID 85f78cbc-a2c9-4daa-b82a-4cf7a9a6389d -->

# Title :
   • "حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار" (States of the Hydraulic Piston at Equilibrium).

# Scenarios & Diagrams :
   ## 1. المكبسان في مستويين مختلفين (Pistons at Different Levels) – Left Panel :
     • Diagram shows two pistons (A and a) at different heights, with piston 2 higher than piston 1 by height h.
     • Forces: f applied on piston a, F on piston A.
     • Fluid levels are uneven.
     • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a = F/A + ρgh.

   ## 2. المكبسان في مستويين مختلفين (Pistons at Different Levels) – Middle Panel :
     • Diagram similar to left, but piston 1 is higher than piston 2 by height h.
     • Forces: f on piston a, F on piston A.
     • Fluid levels are uneven.
     • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a + ρgh = F/A.

   ## 3. المكبسان في نفس المستوى الأفقي (Pistons at the Same Horizontal Level) – Right Panel :
     • Both pistons are at the same height; fluid levels are even.
     • Forces: f on piston a, F on piston A.
     • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a = F/A.

# Equations :
   • For each scenario, the pressure equality and the relationship between force, area, and fluid height difference are shown.
   • ρgh term appears only when pistons are at different heights.

# Visual Elements :
   • Each panel contains a labeled diagram with pistons, fluid, and force arrows.
   • Variables: f, F (forces); a, A (areas); h (height difference); ρ (fluid density); g (gravity).
   • Arabic text labels and equations.

Analysis :
   • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal on both sides (f/a = F/A).
   • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference due to fluid column height (ρgh) must be considered, modifying the force-area relationship.
   • The diagrams and equations clarify how hydraulic equilibrium depends on piston height and area. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID 6ad71441-3734-4958-aedc-5115197919a8 -->
