      "text": "Summary : This figure illustrates the different equilibrium states of a hydraulic piston system, showing the relationship between force, area, and fluid pressure when the pistons are at the same or different heights. It provides diagrams, equations, and explanations for each scenario.\n\ndiagram:\n# Title :\n   • \"حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار\" (States of the Hydraulic Piston at Equilibrium).\n\n# Scenarios & Diagrams :\n   ## 1. المكبسان في مستويين مختلفين (Pistons at Different Levels) – Left Panel :\n     • Diagram shows two pistons (A and a) at different heights, with piston 2 higher than piston 1 by height h.\n     • Forces: f applied on piston a, F on piston A.\n     • Fluid levels are uneven.\n     • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a = F/A + ρgh.\n\n   ## 2. المكبسان في مستويين مختلفين (Pistons at Different Levels) – Middle Panel :\n     • Diagram similar to left, but piston 1 is higher than piston 2 by height h.\n     • Forces: f on piston a, F on piston A.\n     • Fluid levels are uneven.\n     • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a + ρgh = F/A.\n\n   ## 3. المكبسان في نفس المستوى الأفقي (Pistons at the Same Horizontal Level) – Right Panel :\n     • Both pistons are at the same height; fluid levels are even.\n     • Forces: f on piston a, F on piston A.\n     • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a = F/A.\n\n# Equations :\n   • For each scenario, the pressure equality and the relationship between force, area, and fluid height difference are shown.\n   • ρgh term appears only when pistons are at different heights.\n\n# Visual Elements :\n   • Each panel contains a labeled diagram with pistons, fluid, and force arrows.\n   • Variables: f, F (forces); a, A (areas); h (height difference); ρ (fluid density); g (gravity).\n   • Arabic text labels and equations.\n\nAnalysis :\n   • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal on both sides (f/a = F/A).\n   • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference due to fluid column height (ρgh) must be considered, modifying the force-area relationship.\n   • The diagrams and equations clarify how hydraulic equilibrium depends on piston height and area.",
