Summary : This is a labeled schematic illustration of a hydraulic fluid system, showing two pistons of different areas connected by a fluid-filled U-tube, with forces and heights marked to demonstrate hydraulic principles.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The diagram shows a U-shaped tube filled with a hydraulic fluid.
  • On the left side, a large piston (area labeled A) is acted upon by an upward force F.
  • On the right side, a smaller piston (area labeled a) is acted upon by a downward force f.
  • The heights of the fluid columns under each piston are marked as y₂ (left) and y₁ (right).
  • The system is labeled as "السانل الهيدروليكي" (the hydraulic fluid).
  • The figure is labeled as "شكل (1)" (Figure 1).

Technical Details :
  • Forces are indicated: F (upward on the large piston), f (downward on the small piston).
  • Areas of pistons are labeled: A (large), a (small).
  • Vertical distances from the fluid surface to the bottom of each piston are marked: y₂ (left), y₁ (right).
  • The fluid level is continuous between the two arms of the U-tube.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The large piston and force F are on the left, the small piston and force f are on the right.
  • The heights y₂ and y₁ are measured vertically from the fluid surface to the bottom of each piston.
  • The system demonstrates the transmission of force through the hydraulic fluid.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains how a force applied to a large-area piston can be transmitted via hydraulic fluid to produce a different force on a small-area piston, illustrating Pascal’s principle.
  • The difference in heights (y₂ and y₁) and areas (A and a) are key to understanding the mechanical advantage in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.064,t=0.061,r=0.415,b=0.252), with ID f31e322b-4914-41d4-afef-5d4cb280e09f -->

Summary : This illustration demonstrates the principle of hydraulic systems, showing how a force applied to a large piston is transmitted through an incompressible fluid to a smaller piston, resulting in a different force output.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The image shows a U-shaped container filled with liquid, with two vertical cylinders of different diameters attached to each end.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled "A" (area) with a piston on top, and a downward force "F" applied.
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled "a" (area) with a piston on top, and a downward force "f" applied.
  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.
  • The diagram is labeled in Persian as "شکل ۲" (Figure 2).

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or units are provided.
  • The pistons are shown as solid disks fitting tightly in the cylinders.
  • The forces "F" and "f" are indicated by downward arrows.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The larger piston (A) is on the left, the smaller piston (a) is on the right.
  • The liquid connects both pistons, transmitting pressure between them.
  • The dashed line indicates equal liquid levels, signifying balanced pressure.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The system demonstrates how a small force on a small piston can balance a larger force on a larger piston if the ratio of forces equals the ratio of areas (F/A = f/a).
  • This is the foundational concept behind hydraulic lifts and presses. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.472,r=0.278,b=0.611), with ID 2ad1970a-2f00-4a32-8079-29da246f2537 -->

Summary : This figure illustrates the pressure relationships in a hydraulic system with two pistons, comparing cases where the pistons are at different levels versus the same horizontal level, and provides the corresponding pressure equations.

diagram:
# Left and Center Panels: Pistons at Different Levels :
  • Both panels show a U-shaped tube filled with liquid, with two pistons (labeled 1 and 2) of areas "a" and "A" respectively.
  • A force "f" is applied to piston 1 (area "a") and a force "F" to piston 2 (area "A").
  • The liquid level under piston 2 is higher than under piston 1 by a height "h".
  • The pressure equality is stated as P₁ = P₂.
  • The pressure equation is given as: f/a = F/A + ρgh, where ρ is the liquid density and g is gravitational acceleration.
  • Both panels are essentially the same, with minor differences in the depiction of the pistons' positions.

# Right Panel: Pistons at the Same Level :
  • Shows a U-shaped tube with pistons 1 and 2 at the same horizontal level.
  • Forces "f" and "F" are applied to pistons 1 and 2, respectively.
  • The pressure equality is P₁ = P₂.
  • The pressure equation simplifies to: f/a = F/A.

# Headings and Labels :
  • Top left and center: "المكبسـان في مستويين مختلفين" (The pistons at different levels).
  • Top right: "المكبسـان في نفس المستـوى الأفقي" (The pistons at the same horizontal level).
  • Variables: f, F (forces); a, A (areas); h (height difference); ρ (density); g (gravity).

# Analysis :
  • When the pistons are at different levels, the pressure equation includes the hydrostatic term ρgh, accounting for the height difference.
  • When the pistons are at the same level, the hydrostatic term vanishes, and the pressure ratio depends only on the force and area ratios.
  • The diagrams visually reinforce the effect of height difference on pressure transmission in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.651,r=0.888,b=0.892), with ID b85f0b09-7537-4b77-85d3-878fb3fbf3af -->
