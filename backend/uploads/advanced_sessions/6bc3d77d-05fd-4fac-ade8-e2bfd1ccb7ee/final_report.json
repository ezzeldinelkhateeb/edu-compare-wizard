system demonstrates how a small force on a small piston can balance a larger force on a larger piston if the ratio of forces equals the ratio of areas (F/A = f/a).\n  • This is the foundational concept behind hydraulic lifts and presses. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.472,r=0.278,b=0.611), with ID 2ad1970a-2f00-4a32-8079-29da246f2537 -->\n\n- لكي يعود المكبسان في مستوي أفقي واحد كما

to pistons 1 and 2, respectively.\n  • The pressure equality is P₁ = P₂.\n  • The pressure equation simplifies to: f/a = F/A.\n\n# Headings and Labels :\n  • Top left and center: \"المكبسـان في مستويين مختلفين\" (The pistons at different levels).\n  • Top right: \"المكبسـان في نفس المستـوى الأفقي\" (The pistons at the same horizontal level).\n  • Variables: f, F (forces); a, A (areas); h (height difference); ρ (density); g (gravity).\n\n# Analysis :\n  • When the pistons are at different levels, the pressure equation includes the hydrostatic term ρgh, accounting for the height difference.\n  • When the pistons are at the same level, the hydrostatic term vanishes, and the pressure ratio depends only on the force and area ratios.\n  • The diagrams visually reinforce the effect of height difference on pressure transmission in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.651,r=0.888,b=0.892), with ID b85f0b09-7537-4b77-85d3-878fb3fbf3af -->\n\nحيث : (ρ)
