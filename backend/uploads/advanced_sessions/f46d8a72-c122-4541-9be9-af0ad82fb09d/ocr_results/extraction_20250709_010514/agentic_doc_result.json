through a fluid to a larger piston, resulting in a larger output force.\n\nillustration:\n# Diagram Overview :\n  • The diagram shows two connected cylinders (pistons) filled with hydraulic fluid.\n  • The left cylinder has a large piston with area A and force F applied upward.\n  • The right cylinder has a small piston with area a and force f applied downward.\n  • The pistons are at the same horizontal level, and the fluid connects them at the base.\n  • The heights y1 and y2 are marked from the fluid surface to the pistons.\n  • The fluid is labeled as \"السائل الهيدروليكي\" (hydraulic fluid).\n  • The diagram is labeled as \"شكل (1)\" (Figure 1).\n\n# Explanation & Equations :\n  • When the pistons are at the same horizontal level, a force f is applied to the small piston.\n  • This creates a pressure P at the base of the small piston: P = f / a.\n  • The pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid to the base of the large piston.\n  • The resulting force F on the large piston is given by F = P × A, or P = F / A.\n  • The text explains that the pressure is transmitted undiminished to all parts of the fluid and to the bottom of the large piston, causing it to move upward.\n\n# Technical Details :\n  • All variables and forces are clearly labeled in both the diagram and the text.\n  • The explanation is in Arabic and includes step-by-step derivation of the pressure and force relationships.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration and explanation together demonstrate Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished in all directions.\n  • The system shows how a small input force on a small piston can generate a much larger output force on a larger piston, forming the basis of hydraulic lifts and presses.\n  • The diagram visually reinforces the mathematical relationships described in the text. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID 9cc90f2b-c15b-4899-b4c9-b00697466e39 -->\n\n- إذا

subjected to different applied forces.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • The image shows two vertical cylinders connected at the base by a horizontal tube, forming a U-shaped container filled with liquid.\n  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with piston area \"A\" and applied force \"F\" directed downward.\n  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area \"a\" and applied force \"f\" also directed downward.\n  • Both pistons are in contact with the liquid, and the liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.\n  • The diagram is labeled \"شكل ۲\" (Figure 2 in Persian).\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No scale bar or units are provided.\n  • The pistons are depicted as flat, circular disks.\n  • The forces are shown as arrows pointing downwards onto each piston.\n  • The liquid is colored blue for clarity.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The larger cylinder (left) and smaller cylinder (right) are connected at the base, allowing pressure transmission.\n  • The liquid levels are aligned horizontally, indicating balanced pressure.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The figure visually represents Pascal's principle, illustrating how a force applied to a larger piston (area A) can be balanced by a smaller force on a smaller piston (area a) due to the difference in areas, as long as the pressure (F/A = f/a) is equalized in the connected fluid.\n  • The system is in static equilibrium, as shown by the equal liquid levels. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.061,t=0.476,r=0.270,b=0.615), with ID f097397f-adc9-4c2c-aa2e-3945504d8779 -->\n\n- لكي يعود الكبسان

This figure illustrates the different equilibrium states of a hydraulic piston system, showing the pressure relationships and force equations for pistons at equal and unequal heights.\n\ndiagram:\n# Title & Layout :\n  • Title (top right): \"حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار\" (\"Hydraulic piston states at equilibrium\").\n  • Three side-by-side schematic diagrams, each with a descriptive heading and annotated variables.\n  • Left and center: \"المكبان في مستويين مختلفين\" (\"Pistons at different levels\").\n  • Right: \"المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي\" (\"Pistons at the same horizontal level\").\n\n# Diagrams & Variables :\n  ## Left Diagram (Pistons at different levels) :\n    • Two pistons (A and a) at different heights, with piston 2 higher than piston 1 by height h.\n    • Forces: f (on piston a), F (on piston A).\n    • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n    • Equation: f/a = F/A + ρgh.\n\n  ## Center Diagram (Pistons at different levels) :\n    • Two pistons (A and a) at different heights, with piston 1 higher than piston 2 by height h.\n    • Forces: f (on piston a), F (on piston A).\n    • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n    • Equation: f/a + ρgh = F/A.\n\n  ## Right Diagram (Pistons at the same horizontal level) :\n    • Two pistons (A and a) at the same height.\n    • Forces: f (on piston a), F (on piston A).\n    • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n    • Equation: f/a = F/A.\n\n# Equations & Annotations :\n  • Each diagram includes the pressure equality P₁ = P₂ and the corresponding force-area relationship, with or without the ρgh term depending on the height difference.\n  • Variables: f (force on small piston), a (area of small piston), F (force on large piston), A (area of large piston), h (height difference), ρ (fluid density), g (acceleration due to gravity).\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal on both sides (f/a = F/A).\n  • When pistons are at different heights, the hydrostatic pressure difference (ρgh) must be added or subtracted depending on which piston is higher.\n  • The diagrams visually reinforce the effect of height difference on hydraulic pressure transmission. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID a7082747-258b-4c6d-a682-60d2c8fefce9 -->\n\nحيث : (ρ) كثافة السائل ، (h) ارتفاع عمود السائل بين المكبسين. <!-- text,
