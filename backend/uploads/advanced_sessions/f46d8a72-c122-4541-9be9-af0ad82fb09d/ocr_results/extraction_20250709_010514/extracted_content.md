Summary : This is a labeled illustration and accompanying explanation of a hydraulic system demonstrating Pascal's principle, showing how force applied to a small piston is transmitted through a fluid to a larger piston, resulting in a larger output force.

illustration:
# Diagram Overview :
  • The diagram shows two connected cylinders (pistons) filled with hydraulic fluid.
  • The left cylinder has a large piston with area A and force F applied upward.
  • The right cylinder has a small piston with area a and force f applied downward.
  • The pistons are at the same horizontal level, and the fluid connects them at the base.
  • The heights y1 and y2 are marked from the fluid surface to the pistons.
  • The fluid is labeled as "السائل الهيدروليكي" (hydraulic fluid).
  • The diagram is labeled as "شكل (1)" (Figure 1).

# Explanation & Equations :
  • When the pistons are at the same horizontal level, a force f is applied to the small piston.
  • This creates a pressure P at the base of the small piston: P = f / a.
  • The pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid to the base of the large piston.
  • The resulting force F on the large piston is given by F = P × A, or P = F / A.
  • The text explains that the pressure is transmitted undiminished to all parts of the fluid and to the bottom of the large piston, causing it to move upward.

# Technical Details :
  • All variables and forces are clearly labeled in both the diagram and the text.
  • The explanation is in Arabic and includes step-by-step derivation of the pressure and force relationships.

Analysis :
  • The illustration and explanation together demonstrate Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished in all directions.
  • The system shows how a small input force on a small piston can generate a much larger output force on a larger piston, forming the basis of hydraulic lifts and presses.
  • The diagram visually reinforces the mathematical relationships described in the text. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID 9cc90f2b-c15b-4899-b4c9-b00697466e39 -->

Summary : This illustration demonstrates a hydraulic system with two connected cylinders of different cross-sectional areas, each fitted with a piston and subjected to different applied forces.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The image shows two vertical cylinders connected at the base by a horizontal tube, forming a U-shaped container filled with liquid.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with piston area "A" and applied force "F" directed downward.
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area "a" and applied force "f" also directed downward.
  • Both pistons are in contact with the liquid, and the liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.
  • The diagram is labeled "شكل ۲" (Figure 2 in Persian).

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or units are provided.
  • The pistons are depicted as flat, circular disks.
  • The forces are shown as arrows pointing downwards onto each piston.
  • The liquid is colored blue for clarity.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The larger cylinder (left) and smaller cylinder (right) are connected at the base, allowing pressure transmission.
  • The liquid levels are aligned horizontally, indicating balanced pressure.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually represents Pascal's principle, illustrating how a force applied to a larger piston (area A) can be balanced by a smaller force on a smaller piston (area a) due to the difference in areas, as long as the pressure (F/A = f/a) is equalized in the connected fluid.
  • The system is in static equilibrium, as shown by the equal liquid levels. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.061,t=0.476,r=0.270,b=0.615), with ID f097397f-adc9-4c2c-aa2e-3945504d8779 -->

# Title & Layout :
  • Title (top right): "حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار" ("Hydraulic piston states at equilibrium").
  • Three side-by-side schematic diagrams, each with a descriptive heading and annotated variables.
  • Left and center: "المكبان في مستويين مختلفين" ("Pistons at different levels").
  • Right: "المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي" ("Pistons at the same horizontal level").

# Diagrams & Variables :
  ## Left Diagram (Pistons at different levels) :
    • Two pistons (A and a) at different heights, with piston 2 higher than piston 1 by height h.
    • Forces: f (on piston a), F (on piston A).
    • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
    • Equation: f/a = F/A + ρgh.

  ## Center Diagram (Pistons at different levels) :
    • Two pistons (A and a) at different heights, with piston 1 higher than piston 2 by height h.
    • Forces: f (on piston a), F (on piston A).
    • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
    • Equation: f/a + ρgh = F/A.

  ## Right Diagram (Pistons at the same horizontal level) :
    • Two pistons (A and a) at the same height.
    • Forces: f (on piston a), F (on piston A).
    • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
    • Equation: f/a = F/A.

# Equations & Annotations :
  • Each diagram includes the pressure equality P₁ = P₂ and the corresponding force-area relationship, with or without the ρgh term depending on the height difference.
  • Variables: f (force on small piston), a (area of small piston), F (force on large piston), A (area of large piston), h (height difference), ρ (fluid density), g (acceleration due to gravity).

# Analysis :
  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal on both sides (f/a = F/A).
  • When pistons are at different heights, the hydrostatic pressure difference (ρgh) must be added or subtracted depending on which piston is higher.
  • The diagrams visually reinforce the effect of height difference on hydraulic pressure transmission. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID a7082747-258b-4c6d-a682-60d2c8fefce9 -->
