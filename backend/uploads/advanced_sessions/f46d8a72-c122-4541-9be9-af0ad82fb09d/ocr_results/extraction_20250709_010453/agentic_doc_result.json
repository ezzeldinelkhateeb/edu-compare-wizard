between two pistons of different areas.\n\nillustration:\n# Diagram Overview :\n  • The diagram shows two connected cylinders (left and right) filled with hydraulic fluid (labeled \"السائل الهيدروليكي\").\n  • The left cylinder has a large piston with area \"A\" and force \"F\" applied downward.\n  • The right cylinder has a smaller piston with area \"a\" and force \"f\" applied downward.\n  • The heights of the fluid under each piston are labeled \"y1\" (left) and \"y2\" (right).\n  • The pistons are at the same horizontal level.\n\n# Labeled Quantities :\n  • Left piston: Area \"A\", force \"F\", height \"y1\".\n  • Right piston: Area \"a\", force \"f\", height \"y2\".\n  • Both pistons are shown with arrows indicating the direction of applied force (downward).\n\n# Accompanying Text (Key Points) :\n  • When the pistons are at the same horizontal level, a force \"f\" is applied to the small piston.\n  • This creates a pressure \"P\" under the small piston: P = f / a.\n  • The pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid to the large piston.\n  • The large piston experiences an upward force \"F\" given by F = P × A, or P = F / A.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The illustration and text together explain Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.\n  • The diagram visually demonstrates how a small force on a small piston can generate a larger force on a larger piston, forming the basis of hydraulic press operation.\n  • All variables and relationships are clearly labeled, supporting understanding of the pressure and force transmission. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID 35336b42-c5dc-4995-855d-2f77e01b38b0 -->\n\n- إذا تسببت القوة F في تحريك
