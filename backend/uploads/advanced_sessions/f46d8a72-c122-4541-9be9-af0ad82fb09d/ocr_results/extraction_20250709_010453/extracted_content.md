# Diagram Overview :
  • The diagram shows two connected cylinders (left and right) filled with hydraulic fluid (labeled "السائل الهيدروليكي").
  • The left cylinder has a large piston with area "A" and force "F" applied downward.
  • The right cylinder has a smaller piston with area "a" and force "f" applied downward.
  • The heights of the fluid under each piston are labeled "y1" (left) and "y2" (right).
  • The pistons are at the same horizontal level.

# Labeled Quantities :
  • Left piston: Area "A", force "F", height "y1".
  • Right piston: Area "a", force "f", height "y2".
  • Both pistons are shown with arrows indicating the direction of applied force (downward).

# Accompanying Text (Key Points) :
  • When the pistons are at the same horizontal level, a force "f" is applied to the small piston.
  • This creates a pressure "P" under the small piston: P = f / a.
  • The pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid to the large piston.
  • The large piston experiences an upward force "F" given by F = P × A, or P = F / A.

# Analysis :
  • The illustration and text together explain Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The diagram visually demonstrates how a small force on a small piston can generate a larger force on a larger piston, forming the basis of hydraulic press operation.
  • All variables and relationships are clearly labeled, supporting understanding of the pressure and force transmission. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID 35336b42-c5dc-4995-855d-2f77e01b38b0 -->

Summary : This illustration demonstrates the principle of hydraulic systems, showing how a force applied to a large piston is transmitted through a liquid to a smaller piston, resulting in a different force output.

Scene Overview :
  • The image shows two vertical cylinders of different diameters connected at the base by a U-shaped tube filled with liquid.

  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area "a" and force "f" applied downward on the piston.
  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.
  • The diagram is labeled "شكل ۲" (Figure 2 in Persian).

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or units are provided.
  • The pistons are depicted as flat, circular, and fit tightly in their respective cylinders.
  • The forces (F and f) are shown as vertical arrows pointing downward on each piston.

Spatial Relationships :
