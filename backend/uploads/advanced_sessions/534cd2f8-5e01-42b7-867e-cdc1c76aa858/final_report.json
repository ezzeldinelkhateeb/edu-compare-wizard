as \"شکل ۲\" (Figure 2).\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No scale bar or units are provided.\n  • Forces are denoted by \"F\" (large piston) and \"f\" (small piston).\n  • Areas are denoted by \"A\"

are connected by the liquid in the U-tube.\n  • The pistons are at the same vertical height, indicating pressure transmission.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.\n  • The force applied to the large piston (F) over area (A) creates a pressure that is transmitted to the small piston (f) over area (a), such that F/A = f/a.\n  • The system demonstrates how a small force applied to a large area can be converted to a larger force on a smaller area, or vice versa, depending on the relative sizes of A and a. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.472,r=0.278,b=0.611), with ID 65773504-8619-43ad-8446-819afa11862f -->\n\n-  لكي يعود المكبسان في مستوي أفقي واحد كما في الشكل (2)

pistons, comparing cases where the pistons are at different levels versus the same horizontal level, and provides the corresponding pressure equations.\n\ndiagram:\n# Pistons at Different Levels :\n  • Two sub-diagrams on the left show pistons labeled \"1\" (area a, force f) and \"2\" (area A, force F) in U-shaped tubes with fluid.\n  • In both, piston 2 is higher than piston 1 by a height h.\n  • The pressure at the bottom of both sides is set equal: P₁ = P₂.\n  • The pressure equation is: f/a = F/A + ρgh, where ρ is fluid density and g is gravitational acceleration.\n\n# Pistons at the Same Horizontal Level :\n  • The rightmost diagram shows pistons 1 and 2 at the same fluid level.\n  • The pressure at the bottom of both sides is equal: P₁ = P₂.\n  • The pressure equation simplifies to: f/a = F/A.\n\n# Equations and Annotations :\n  • All diagrams include the pressure equality P₁ = P₂.\n  • The left and center diagrams include the hydrostatic term ρgh due to the height difference.\n  • The right diagram omits the ρgh term since the pistons are level.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference includes a hydrostatic term (ρgh).\n  • When pistons are level, the pressure relationship depends only on the ratio of forces to areas.\n  • The diagrams visually reinforce the effect of height difference on pressure transmission in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.651,r=0.888,b=0.892), with ID a31e8f20-d089-4f04-8306-6ec65f06c387 -->\n\nحيث : (ρ) كثافة السائل ، (h) ارتفاع عمود السائل بين المكبسـين. <!-- text, from

the Same Horizontal Level\") :\n  • Both pistons at the same height.\n  • Forces f (area a) and F (area A) applied.\n  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a = F/A.\n\n# Design Encodings :\n  • Each panel uses schematic U-tube diagrams with pistons and fluid.\n  • Forces indicated by arrows.\n  • Equations written below each diagram.\n  • Arabic text for headings and labels.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the pressure ratio equals the force-to-area ratio (f/a = F/A).\n  • When pistons are at different heights, the hydrostatic pressure difference (ρgh) must be included in the pressure balance.\n  • The direction of the height difference (which piston is higher) determines whether ρgh is added to or subtracted from the force/area ratio.\n  • The diagrams and equations together clarify how hydraulic equilibrium is affected by piston height and area. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID
