Summary : This is a labeled illustration of a hydraulic fluid system, showing two pistons of different areas connected by a U-shaped tube filled with hydraulic fluid, with forces and heights indicated to demonstrate Pascal's principle.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The diagram shows a U-shaped container filled with hydraulic fluid.
  • On the left side, a large piston with area "A" is acted upon by an upward force "F".
  • On the right side, a smaller piston with area "a" is acted upon by a downward force "f".
  • The heights of the fluid columns under each piston are labeled as y₁ (right) and y₂ (left).
  • The system is labeled as "السانل الهيدروليكي" (the hydraulic fluid).
  • The figure is labeled as "شكل (1)" (Figure 1).

Technical Details :
  • The pistons are shown as circular disks fitting into the vertical tubes.
  • The left piston is larger than the right piston.
  • The fluid level is higher on the right side (y₁) than on the left (y₂).
  • Forces are indicated with arrows: "F" (upward, left), "f" (downward, right).

Spatial Relationships :
  • The two pistons are at different heights, with the left piston lower than the right.
  • The U-tube connects the two pistons, allowing pressure transmission between them.
  • The difference in piston area and height illustrates the mechanical advantage in hydraulic systems.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually demonstrates Pascal's principle: a force applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The difference in piston areas and heights suggests how a small force on a small piston can balance a larger force on a larger piston, or vice versa, depending on the areas and heights.
  • The system is set up to explain the relationship between force, area, and pressure in hydraulic machines. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.064,t=0.061,r=0.415,b=0.252), with ID 40b91a5a-6ccf-40e0-bccb-cd32939b6081 -->

Summary : This illustration demonstrates the principle of hydraulic systems, showing how a force applied to a large piston is transmitted through an incompressible fluid to a smaller piston, resulting in a different force output.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The image shows a U-shaped container filled with liquid, with two vertical cylinders of different diameters attached to each end.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled "A" (area) with a piston on top, and a downward force "F" applied.
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled "a" (area) with a piston on top, and a downward force "f" applied.
  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.
  • The diagram is labeled in Persian as "شکل ۲" (Figure 2).

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or units are provided.
  • Forces are denoted by "F" (large piston) and "f" (small piston).
  • Areas are denoted by "A" (large piston) and "a" (small piston).
  • The pistons are shown as solid disks fitting tightly in the cylinders.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The large piston (left) and small piston (right) are connected by the liquid in the U-tube.
  • The pistons are at the same vertical height, indicating pressure transmission.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The force applied to the large piston (F) over area (A) creates a pressure that is transmitted to the small piston (f) over area (a), such that F/A = f/a.
  • The system demonstrates how a small force applied to a large area can be converted to a larger force on a smaller area, or vice versa, depending on the relative sizes of A and a. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.472,r=0.278,b=0.611), with ID 65773504-8619-43ad-8446-819afa11862f -->

Summary : This figure illustrates the pressure relationships in a hydraulic system with two pistons, comparing cases where the pistons are at different levels versus the same horizontal level, and provides the corresponding pressure equations.

diagram:
# Pistons at Different Levels :
  • Two sub-diagrams on the left show pistons labeled "1" (area a, force f) and "2" (area A, force F) in U-shaped tubes with fluid.
  • In both, piston 2 is higher than piston 1 by a height h.
  • The pressure at the bottom of both sides is set equal: P₁ = P₂.
  • The pressure equation is: f/a = F/A + ρgh, where ρ is fluid density and g is gravitational acceleration.

# Pistons at the Same Horizontal Level :
  • The rightmost diagram shows pistons 1 and 2 at the same fluid level.
  • The pressure at the bottom of both sides is equal: P₁ = P₂.
  • The pressure equation simplifies to: f/a = F/A.

# Equations and Annotations :
  • All diagrams include the pressure equality P₁ = P₂.
  • The left and center diagrams include the hydrostatic term ρgh due to the height difference.
  • The right diagram omits the ρgh term since the pistons are level.

# Analysis :
  • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference includes a hydrostatic term (ρgh).
  • When pistons are level, the pressure relationship depends only on the ratio of forces to areas.
  • The diagrams visually reinforce the effect of height difference on pressure transmission in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.651,r=0.888,b=0.892), with ID a31e8f20-d089-4f04-8306-6ec65f06c387 -->
