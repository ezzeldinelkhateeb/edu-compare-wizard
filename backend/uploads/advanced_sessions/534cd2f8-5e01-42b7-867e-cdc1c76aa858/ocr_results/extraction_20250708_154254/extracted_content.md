Summary : This is a labeled illustration explaining the operation of a hydraulic press, accompanied by Arabic text describing the physical principles and equations involved.

illustration:
# Diagram Overview :
  • Two connected cylinders (left and right) filled with hydraulic fluid ("السائل الهيدروليكي").
  • Left cylinder: large piston with area labeled "A", force "F" applied downward, vertical distance "y1".
  • Right cylinder: small piston with area "a", force "f" applied downward, vertical distance "y2".
  • Both pistons are at the same horizontal level.
  • Arrows indicate the direction of applied forces and movement.
  • Labeled as "شكل (1)".

# On-Image Labels :
  • "A" and "a" for piston areas.
  • "F" and "f" for applied forces.
  • "y1" and "y2" for vertical distances.
  • "السائل الهيدروليكي" (hydraulic fluid).

# Accompanying Text (Arabic, paraphrased) :
  • Describes that when the pistons are at the same horizontal level and a force "f" is applied to the small piston, a pressure "P" is generated at the bottom of the small piston: P = f/a.
  • This pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid to the bottom of the large piston, resulting in an upward force "F" on the large piston: P = F/A.
  • Explains Pascal's principle and the transmission of pressure in hydraulic systems.

# Equations Shown :
  • P = f / a
  • P = F / A

# Analysis :
  • The illustration visually demonstrates Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The diagram and equations show how a small force applied to a small piston can generate a much larger force on a larger piston, forming the basis of hydraulic presses and lifts.
  • The labeled areas and forces clarify the mathematical relationship between input and output forces in the system. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID f1ab9189-a3d1-4061-b589-4e7d6c268ea2 -->

Summary : This illustration demonstrates the principle of hydraulic systems, showing how a force applied to a large piston is transmitted through a fluid to a smaller piston, resulting in a different force output.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The image shows two vertical cylinders of different diameters connected at the base by a U-shaped tube filled with liquid.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with piston area "A" and force "F" applied downward on the piston.
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area "a" and force "f" applied downward on the piston.
  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.
  • The pistons are shown as flat disks sitting atop the liquid in each cylinder.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or units are present.
  • The diagram is schematic, with clear labels for forces (F, f) and areas (A, a).
  • The image is labeled "شكل ۲" (Figure 2) in Persian at the bottom.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The larger piston (left) and smaller piston (right) are connected by the same fluid, illustrating pressure transmission.
  • The pistons are aligned horizontally at the same fluid level, emphasizing equal pressure at the same depth.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The difference in piston areas and applied forces suggests the relationship F/A = f/a, a foundational concept in hydraulic systems.
  • The equal fluid levels indicate static equilibrium, reinforcing the pressure balance. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.061,t=0.476,r=0.270,b=0.615), with ID 16f01e88-a863-4329-b1f6-2a75dfb0373d -->

# Title & Sections :
  • Title at top: "حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار" ("States of the Hydraulic Piston at Equilibrium").
  • Three main panels, each showing a different configuration of pistons and fluid levels.

# Left Panel – المكبسان في مستويين مختلفين ("Pistons at Different Levels") :
  • Diagram shows two pistons (A and a) at different heights, with piston 2 higher than piston 1.
  • Forces labeled: f on piston 1 (area a), F on piston 2 (area A).
  • Height difference labeled h.
  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a = F/A + ρgh.

# Center Panel – المكبسان في مستويين مختلفين ("Pistons at Different Levels") :
  • Diagram similar to left, but piston 1 is higher than piston 2.
  • Forces and areas labeled as before.
  • Height difference h shown.
  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a + ρgh = F/A.

# Right Panel – المكبسان في نفس المستوى الأفقي ("Pistons at the Same Horizontal Level") :
  • Both pistons at the same height.
  • Forces f (area a) and F (area A) applied.
  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a = F/A.

# Design Encodings :
  • Each panel uses schematic U-tube diagrams with pistons and fluid.
  • Forces indicated by arrows.
  • Equations written below each diagram.
  • Arabic text for headings and labels.

# Analysis :
  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the pressure ratio equals the force-to-area ratio (f/a = F/A).
  • When pistons are at different heights, the hydrostatic pressure difference (ρgh) must be included in the pressure balance.
  • The direction of the height difference (which piston is higher) determines whether ρgh is added to or subtracted from the force/area ratio.
  • The diagrams and equations together clarify how hydraulic equilibrium is affected by piston height and area. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID 1f731ab8-cbbc-4fe0-9698-ca93701c217d -->
