pistons are at the same horizontal level and a force \"f\" is applied to the small piston, a pressure \"P\" is generated at the bottom of the small piston: P = f/a.\n  • This pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid to the bottom of the large piston, resulting in an upward force \"F\" on the large piston: P = F/A.\n  • Explains Pascal's principle and the transmission of pressure in hydraulic systems.\n\n# Equations Shown :\n  • P = f / a\n  • P = F / A\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The illustration visually demonstrates Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.\n  • The diagram and equations show how a small force applied to a small piston can generate a much larger force on a larger piston, forming the basis of hydraulic presses and lifts.\n  • The labeled areas and forces clarify the mathematical relationship between input and output forces in the system. <!-- figure, from page 0

pressure when the pistons are at the same or different levels, with corresponding equations.\n\ndiagram:\n# Title & Sections :\n  • Title at top: \"حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار\" (\"States of the Hydraulic Piston at Equilibrium\").\n  • Three main panels, each showing a different configuration of pistons and fluid levels.\n\n# Left Panel – المكبسان في مستويين مختلفين (\"Pistons at Different Levels\") :\n  • Diagram shows two pistons (A and a) at different heights, with piston 2 higher than piston 1.\n  • Forces labeled: f on piston 1 (area a), F on piston 2 (area A).\n  • Height difference labeled h.\n  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a = F/A + ρgh.\n\n# Center Panel – المكبسان في مستويين مختلفين (\"Pistons at Different Levels\") :\n  • Diagram similar to left, but piston 1 is higher than piston 2.\n  • Forces and areas labeled as before.\n  • Height difference h shown.\n  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a + ρgh = F/A.\n\n# Right Panel – المكبسان في نفس المستوى الأفقي (\"Pistons at the Same Horizontal Level\") :\n  • Both pistons at the same height.\n  • Forces f (area a) and F (area A) applied.\n  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a = F/A.\n\n# Design Encodings :\n  • Each panel uses schematic U-tube diagrams with pistons and fluid.\n  • Forces indicated by arrows.\n  • Equations written below each diagram.\n  • Arabic text for headings and labels.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the pressure ratio equals the force-to-area ratio (f/a = F/A).\n  • When pistons are at different heights, the hydrostatic pressure difference (ρgh) must be included in the pressure balance.\n  • The direction of the height difference (which piston is higher) determines whether ρgh is added to or subtracted from the force/area ratio.\n  • The diagrams and equations together clarify how hydraulic equilibrium is affected by piston height and area. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID

      "text": "Summary : This figure illustrates the different equilibrium states of a hydraulic piston system, showing the relationship between force, area, and pressure when the pistons are at the same or different levels, with corresponding equations.\n\ndiagram:\n# Title & Sections :\n  • Title at top: \"حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار\" (\"States of the Hydraulic Piston at Equilibrium\").\n  • Three main panels, each showing a different configuration of pistons and fluid levels.\n\n# Left Panel – المكبسان في مستويين مختلفين (\"Pistons at Different Levels\") :\n  • Diagram shows two pistons (A and a) at different heights, with piston 2 higher than piston 1.\n  • Forces labeled: f on piston 1 (area a), F on piston 2 (area A).\n  • Height difference labeled h.\n  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a = F/A + ρgh.\n\n# Center Panel – المكبسان في مستويين مختلفين (\"Pistons at Different Levels\") :\n  • Diagram similar to left, but piston 1 is higher than piston 2.\n  • Forces and areas labeled as before.\n  • Height difference h shown.\n  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a + ρgh = F/A.\n\n# Right Panel – المكبسان في نفس المستوى الأفقي (\"Pistons at the Same Horizontal Level\") :\n  • Both pistons at the same height.\n  • Forces f (area a) and F (area A) applied.\n  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a = F/A.\n\n# Design Encodings :\n  • Each panel uses schematic U-tube diagrams with pistons and fluid.\n  • Forces indicated by arrows.\n  • Equations written below each diagram.\n  • Arabic text for headings and labels.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the pressure ratio equals the force-to-area ratio (f/a = F/A).\n  • When pistons are at different heights, the hydrostatic pressure difference (ρgh) must be included in the pressure balance.\n  • The direction of the height difference (which piston is higher) determines whether ρgh is added to or subtracted from the force/area ratio.\n  • The diagrams and equations together clarify how hydraulic equilibrium is affected by piston height and area.",
