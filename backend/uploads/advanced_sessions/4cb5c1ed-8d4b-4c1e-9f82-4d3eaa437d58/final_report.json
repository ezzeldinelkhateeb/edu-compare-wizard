The forces and areas suggest the relationship F/A = f/a.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration demonstrates how a small force applied to a small-area piston can balance a larger force on a larger-area

difference on pressure transmission and the resulting equations.\n\nillustration:\n# Left Panel: Pistons at Different Levels (Piston 2 Higher)\n  • Shows a U-shaped tube with two pistons: piston 1 (area a, force f) on the left at a lower level, piston 2 (area A, force F) on the right at a higher level (height difference h).\n  • Equation: \\( P_1 = P_2 \\)\n  • Pressure relationship: \\(

large piston), A (area of large piston), h (height difference), ρ (density), g (gravity).\n\n# Analysis :\n  • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure equation includes a term for the hydrostatic pressure difference (\\( \\rho g h \\)), either added or subtracted depending on which piston is higher.\n  • When pistons are at the same level, the pressure relationship simplifies to the ratio of forces to areas.\n  • The figure visually and mathematically demonstrates Pascal’s principle and the effect of height on pressure transmission in fluids. <!-- figure, from page 0
