It provides the pressure equations for each scenario.\n\ndiagram:\n# Title :\n  • Title in Arabic: \"حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار\" (Hydraulic Piston States at Equilibrium).\n\n# Scenarios :\n  ## 1. Pistons at Different Levels (left and center panels) :\n    • Two sub-cases are shown, both with pistons at different vertical positions.\n    • Both show a small piston (area a, force f) and a large piston (area A, force F) connected by a fluid.\n    • The height difference between pistons is labeled h.\n    • The pressure equality is given as P₁ = P₂.\n    • The pressure equation: (f/a) = (F/A) + ρgh (left) and (f/a) + ρgh = (F/A) (center).\n\n  ## 2. Pistons at the Same Level (right panel) :\n    • Both pistons are at the same horizontal level.\n    • The pressure equality is given as P₁ = P₂.\n    • The pressure equation: (f/a) = (F/A).\n\n# Visual Elements :\n  • Each scenario is depicted with a U-shaped tube filled with fluid, pistons on each side, and arrows indicating applied forces.\n  • Variables are labeled: f (small force), a (small area), F (large force), A (large area), h (height difference), ρ (fluid density), g (gravity).\n  • Dashed lines indicate reference levels for pressure measurement.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal on both sides.\n  • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference due to fluid column height (ρgh) must be included in the force balance.\n  • The equations summarize how hydraulic systems transmit force and how fluid height affects pressure equilibrium.",
