Summary : This is a labeled diagram and accompanying explanation illustrating the operation of a hydraulic press system, showing how force applied to a small piston is transmitted through a hydraulic fluid to a larger piston, with mathematical relationships for pressure and force.

illustration:
# Diagram Overview :
  • The diagram shows two connected cylinders (left and right) filled with hydraulic fluid (labeled "السائل الهيدروليكي").
  • The left cylinder contains a large piston with area A, on which an upward force F acts.
  • The right cylinder contains a small piston with area a, on which a downward force f acts.
  • Both pistons are at the same horizontal level, with vertical distances y1 and y2 marked from the fluid surface to the pistons.
  • The system is labeled as "شكل 1" (Figure 1).

# Mathematical Relationships :
  • The pressure P under the small piston is given by P = f / a.
  • This pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid to the large piston.
  • The force F on the large piston is related to the pressure and area by P = F / A.

# Explanatory Text (in Arabic) :
  • Describes that when both pistons are at the same horizontal level and a force f is applied to the small piston, a pressure P is generated under it.
  • This pressure is transmitted uniformly through the hydraulic fluid to the large piston, resulting in an upward force F.
  • The relationships P = f / a and P = F / A are highlighted.

# Analysis :
  • The diagram and text together illustrate Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The system demonstrates how a small force applied to a small piston can generate a larger force on a larger piston, depending on the ratio of their areas.
  • The mathematical relationships allow calculation of the output force given the input force and piston areas. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID c4a234f8-a548-4beb-8e2a-bc08163c806f -->

Summary : This illustration shows a U-shaped hydraulic system with two pistons of different areas, each subjected to a downward force, demonstrating the principle of hydraulic pressure transmission.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The system consists of two vertical cylinders connected at the base by a horizontal tube, forming a U-shape filled with liquid.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with piston area "A" and downward force "F".
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area "a" and downward force "f".
  • Both pistons are shown pressing down on the liquid, with the liquid level equal on both sides.
  • The diagram is labeled "شكل ۲" (Figure 2 in Persian/Arabic numerals).

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or units are provided.
  • The pistons are depicted as flat, circular disks fitting tightly in their respective cylinders.
  • The forces "F" and "f" are indicated by downward arrows above each piston.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The larger piston (A) is on the left, the smaller piston (a) is on the right.
  • The liquid level is shown as a dashed horizontal line, indicating equilibrium.
  • The connecting tube at the base allows pressure transmission between the two sides.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually demonstrates Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The difference in piston areas suggests a mechanical advantage, where a small force on the small piston can balance a larger force on the large piston if the ratio of forces equals the ratio of areas (F/A = f/a).
  • The equal liquid levels indicate static equilibrium, with pressures balanced on both sides. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.061,t=0.476,r=0.270,b=0.615), with ID 7fed30f8-28d6-4794-8bfd-c435b5b91c12 -->

Summary : This figure illustrates the different equilibrium states of a hydraulic piston system, showing the relationship between force, area, and fluid pressure when the pistons are at the same or different heights. It provides the pressure equations for each scenario.

diagram:
# Title :
  • Title in Arabic: "حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار" (Hydraulic Piston States at Equilibrium).

# Scenarios :
  ## 1. Pistons at Different Levels (left and center panels) :
    • Two sub-cases are shown, both with pistons at different vertical positions.
    • Both show a small piston (area a, force f) and a large piston (area A, force F) connected by a fluid.
    • The height difference between pistons is labeled h.
    • The pressure equality is given as P₁ = P₂.
    • The pressure equation: (f/a) = (F/A) + ρgh (left) and (f/a) + ρgh = (F/A) (center).

  ## 2. Pistons at the Same Level (right panel) :
    • Both pistons are at the same horizontal level.
    • The pressure equality is given as P₁ = P₂.
    • The pressure equation: (f/a) = (F/A).

# Visual Elements :
  • Each scenario is depicted with a U-shaped tube filled with fluid, pistons on each side, and arrows indicating applied forces.
  • Variables are labeled: f (small force), a (small area), F (large force), A (large area), h (height difference), ρ (fluid density), g (gravity).
  • Dashed lines indicate reference levels for pressure measurement.

# Analysis :
  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal on both sides.
  • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference due to fluid column height (ρgh) must be included in the force balance.
  • The equations summarize how hydraulic systems transmit force and how fluid height affects pressure equilibrium. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID aecb5e59-9a04-4b51-9266-5384e6389503 -->
