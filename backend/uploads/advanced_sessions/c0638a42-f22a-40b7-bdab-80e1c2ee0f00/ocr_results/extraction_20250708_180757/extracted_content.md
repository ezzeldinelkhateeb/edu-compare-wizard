Summary : This is a labeled schematic illustration of a hydraulic fluid system, showing two pistons of different areas connected by a fluid-filled U-tube, with forces and heights indicated to demonstrate hydraulic principles.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The diagram shows a U-shaped container filled with a hydraulic fluid.
  • On the left side, a large piston (area labeled A) is acted upon by an upward force F.
  • On the right side, a smaller piston (area labeled a) is acted upon by a downward force f.
  • The heights of the fluid columns under each piston are marked as y₁ (right) and y₂ (left).
  • The system is labeled as "السانل الهيدروليكي" (the hydraulic fluid).
  • The figure is labeled as "شكل (1)" (Figure 1).

Technical Details :
  • The pistons are shown as circular disks with rods.
  • The left piston is larger than the right piston.
  • The fluid level is higher on the right side (y₁) than on the left (y₂).
  • Forces are indicated with arrows: F (upward, left), f (downward, right).
  • The areas of the pistons are labeled as A (left) and a (right).

Spatial Relationships :
  • The left piston (A, F) is at a lower fluid height (y₂) compared to the right piston (a, f) at height (y₁).
  • The two pistons are connected by the same continuous fluid, illustrating pressure transmission.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually demonstrates Pascal’s principle: a force applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The difference in piston areas and heights suggests a mechanical advantage, where a small force on the small piston can balance a larger force on the large piston if the areas and heights are appropriately related.
  • The diagram is likely used to explain the operation of hydraulic lifts or presses. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.064,t=0.061,r=0.415,b=0.252), with ID 72803bfa-95d1-4ac9-b3fe-fd2b98040995 -->

Summary : This illustration demonstrates the principle of hydraulic systems, showing how a force applied to a larger piston (area A) is transmitted through an incompressible fluid to a smaller piston (area a), resulting in a different force output.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Two vertical cylinders of different diameters are connected at the base by a U-shaped tube filled with liquid.
  • The left cylinder is wider, labeled with piston area "A" and downward force "F" applied on its piston.
  • The right cylinder is narrower, labeled with piston area "a" and downward force "f" applied on its piston.
  • The liquid levels in both cylinders are equal, indicated by a dashed horizontal line.
  • The diagram is labeled "شكل ۲" (Figure 2 in Persian/Arabic numerals).

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or units are provided.
  • The pistons are shown as solid disks fitting tightly in their respective cylinders.
  • The forces F and f are indicated by bold downward arrows.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The left (larger) cylinder is on the left side of the image, the right (smaller) cylinder is on the right.
  • The connecting tube is at the bottom, ensuring the fluid is continuous between both sides.
  • The pistons are at the same vertical height, suggesting equilibrium.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually explains Pascal's principle: a force applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The difference in piston areas (A > a) implies that the forces F and f are related by the ratio of the areas (F/A = f/a).
  • The equal fluid levels indicate the system is in static equilibrium. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.472,r=0.278,b=0.611), with ID 9557dd18-d16f-4cc6-9243-e293c8318f94 -->

Summary : This figure illustrates the pressure relationships in a hydraulic system with two pistons, comparing cases where the pistons are at different levels versus the same horizontal level, and provides the corresponding pressure equations.

diagram:
# Left and Center Panels: Pistons at Different Levels :
  • Both panels show a U-shaped tube filled with liquid, with two pistons (1 and 2) of areas "a" and "A" respectively.
  • A force "f" is applied to piston 1 (area "a"), and a force "F" is applied to piston 2 (area "A").
  • The liquid levels under the pistons are at different heights, with a vertical distance "h" between them.
  • The pressure at the bottom of both sides is set equal: P₁ = P₂.
  • The pressure equation is: (f/a) = (F/A) + ρgh, where ρ is the liquid density and g is gravitational acceleration.
  • The left and center panels differ only in the direction of the applied force and the reference points for the height "h".

# Right Panel: Pistons at the Same Level :
  • Shows a U-shaped tube with pistons 1 and 2 at the same horizontal level.
  • Forces "f" and "F" are applied to pistons 1 and 2, respectively.
  • The pressure at the bottom of both sides is equal: P₁ = P₂.
  • The pressure equation simplifies to: (f/a) = (F/A), since the height difference is zero.

# Headings and Labels :
  • Top left and center: "المكبسـان في مستويين مختلفين" ("The pistons at different levels").
  • Top right: "المكبسـان في نفس المستـوى الأفقي" ("The pistons at the same horizontal level").
  • Each panel includes schematic diagrams, force labels (f, F), area labels (a, A), and pressure equations.

# Analysis :
  • When the pistons are at different heights, the pressure applied to the smaller piston must overcome both the force on the larger piston and the hydrostatic pressure due to the height difference (ρgh).
  • When the pistons are at the same level, the pressure relationship depends only on the ratio of the applied forces to their respective areas.
  • The diagrams visually reinforce Pascal's principle and the effect of hydrostatic pressure in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.651,r=0.888,b=0.892), with ID f3310b46-380a-4486-8652-e4385637bc79 -->
