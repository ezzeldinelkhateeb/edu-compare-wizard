The diagram is accompanied by Arabic text explaining the process and relevant equations.\n\nillustration:\n# Diagram Components :\n  • Two vertical cylinders (left and right) connected at the base by a horizontal tube, both filled with hydraulic fluid (labeled \"السائل الهيدروليكي\").\n  • Left cylinder: Large piston with area \"A\" and force \"F\" applied downward.\n  • Right cylinder: Small piston with area \"a\" and force \"f\" applied downward.\n  • Vertical distances \"y1\" and \"y2\" are marked from the fluid surface to the bottom of each piston.\n  • Arrows indicate the direction of applied forces on both pistons.\n\n# Arabic Text Explanation :\n  • Describes the scenario where both pistons are at the same horizontal level.\n  • States that applying a force \"f\" to the small piston creates a pressure \"P\" at the bottom of the small piston, given by P = f / a.\n  • Explains that this pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid to the bottom of the large piston.\n  • The resulting force \"F\" on the large piston is given by F = P × A, or equivalently, P = F / A.\n\n# Equations :\n  • P = f / a\n  • P = F / A\n\n# Labels and Notations :\n  • \"A\" and \"a\" denote the areas of the large and small pistons, respectively.\n  • \"F\" and \"f\" denote the forces applied to the large and small pistons, respectively.\n  • \"y1\" and \"y2\" are vertical distances from the fluid surface to the pistons.\n  • \"السائل الهيدروليكي\" labels the hydraulic fluid.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure visually demonstrates Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.\n  • The system allows a small input force on a small piston to generate a much larger output force on a larger piston, depending on the ratio of their areas.\n  • The equations and diagram together clarify the relationship between input force, output force, and piston areas in a hydraulic press. <!-- figure, from page 0

subjected to different forces.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • The system consists of two vertical cylinders connected at the base, forming a U-shape filled with liquid.\n  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with piston area \"A\" and force \"F\" applied downward.\n  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area \"a\" and force \"f\" applied downward.\n  • Both pistons are shown pressing down on the liquid, with the liquid level equal in both arms.\n  • The diagram is labeled \"شكل ۲\" (Figure 2 in Persian/Arabic numerals).\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No scale bar or magnification is present.\n  • The pistons are depicted as flat, circular disks fitting tightly in their respective cylinders.\n  • The liquid is shown as a uniform blue fill, indicating an incompressible fluid.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The larger cylinder (left) and smaller cylinder (right) are connected at the base, allowing pressure transmission.\n  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.\n  • The force F is applied to the larger piston (area A), and force f is applied to the smaller piston (area a).\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration visually demonstrates Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.\n  • The system suggests that the ratio of forces to areas (F/A = f/a) is key to the hydraulic mechanism.\n  • The equal liquid levels indicate static equilibrium, with forces balanced according to the areas of the pistons. <!-- figure, from page 0

the relationship between force, area, and pressure when the pistons are at the same or different levels, with corresponding equations.\n\ndiagram:\n# Title & Layout :\n  • Title (top right): \"حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار\" (\"Hydraulic piston states at equilibrium\").\n  • Three side-by-side schematic diagrams, each with a descriptive heading.\n  • Left and center: \"المكبان في مستويين مختلفين\" (\"Pistons at different levels\").\n  • Right: \"المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي\" (\"Pistons at the same horizontal level\").\n\n# Diagrams & Labels :\n  • Each diagram shows a U-shaped tube filled with liquid, with two pistons (labeled 1 and 2) of different areas (a and A) and forces (f and F) applied.\n  • Left and center diagrams: Pistons are at different heights, with a height difference h marked.\n  • Right diagram: Pistons are at the same horizontal level.\n  • All diagrams label the forces (f, F), areas (a, A), and height difference (h) where applicable.\n\n# Equations :\n  • Left and center diagrams (different levels): \n    - \"P₁ = P₂\"\n    - \"f/a = F/A + ρgh\"\n    - \"f/a + ρgh = F/A\"\n  • Right diagram (same level): \n    - \"P₁ = P₂\"\n    - \"f/a = F/A\"\n  • ρ (rho) denotes fluid density, g is gravitational acceleration, h is height difference.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the pressure ratio equals the force-to-area ratio (f/a = F/A).\n  • When pistons are at different levels, the pressure difference due to the height of the fluid column (ρgh) must be considered, modifying the force-area relationship.\n  • The diagrams and equations together clarify how hydraulic equilibrium depends on both piston area and height difference in the fluid. <!-- figure, from page 0

      "text": "Summary : This figure illustrates the different equilibrium states of a hydraulic piston system, showing the relationship between force, area, and pressure when the pistons are at the same or different levels, with corresponding equations.\n\ndiagram:\n# Title & Layout :\n  • Title (top right): \"حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار\" (\"Hydraulic piston states at equilibrium\").\n  • Three side-by-side schematic diagrams, each with a descriptive heading.\n  • Left and center: \"المكبان في مستويين مختلفين\" (\"Pistons at different levels\").\n  • Right: \"المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي\" (\"Pistons at the same horizontal level\").\n\n# Diagrams & Labels :\n  • Each diagram shows a U-shaped tube filled with liquid, with two pistons (labeled 1 and 2) of different areas (a and A) and forces (f and F) applied.\n  • Left and center diagrams: Pistons are at different heights, with a height difference h marked.\n  • Right diagram: Pistons are at the same horizontal level.\n  • All diagrams label the forces (f, F), areas (a, A), and height difference (h) where applicable.\n\n# Equations :\n  • Left and center diagrams (different levels): \n    - \"P₁ = P₂\"\n    - \"f/a = F/A + ρgh\"\n    - \"f/a + ρgh = F/A\"\n  • Right diagram (same level): \n    - \"P₁ = P₂\"\n    - \"f/a = F/A\"\n  • ρ (rho) denotes fluid density, g is gravitational acceleration, h is height difference.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the pressure ratio equals the force-to-area ratio (f/a = F/A).\n  • When pistons are at different levels, the pressure difference due to the height of the fluid column (ρgh) must be considered, modifying the force-area relationship.\n  • The diagrams and equations together clarify how hydraulic equilibrium depends on both piston area and height difference in the fluid.",
