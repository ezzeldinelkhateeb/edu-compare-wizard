Summary : This figure illustrates the working principle of a hydraulic press, showing how a force applied to a small piston is transmitted through a hydraulic fluid to a larger piston, resulting in a larger output force. The diagram is accompanied by Arabic text explaining the process and relevant equations.

illustration:
# Diagram Components :
  • Two vertical cylinders (left and right) connected at the base by a horizontal tube, both filled with hydraulic fluid (labeled "السائل الهيدروليكي").
  • Left cylinder: Large piston with area "A" and force "F" applied downward.
  • Right cylinder: Small piston with area "a" and force "f" applied downward.
  • Vertical distances "y1" and "y2" are marked from the fluid surface to the bottom of each piston.
  • Arrows indicate the direction of applied forces on both pistons.

# Arabic Text Explanation :
  • Describes the scenario where both pistons are at the same horizontal level.
  • States that applying a force "f" to the small piston creates a pressure "P" at the bottom of the small piston, given by P = f / a.
  • Explains that this pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid to the bottom of the large piston.
  • The resulting force "F" on the large piston is given by F = P × A, or equivalently, P = F / A.

# Equations :
  • P = f / a
  • P = F / A

# Labels and Notations :
  • "A" and "a" denote the areas of the large and small pistons, respectively.
  • "F" and "f" denote the forces applied to the large and small pistons, respectively.
  • "y1" and "y2" are vertical distances from the fluid surface to the pistons.
  • "السائل الهيدروليكي" labels the hydraulic fluid.

# Analysis :
  • The figure visually demonstrates Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The system allows a small input force on a small piston to generate a much larger output force on a larger piston, depending on the ratio of their areas.
  • The equations and diagram together clarify the relationship between input force, output force, and piston areas in a hydraulic press. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID 8bb20a47-1f3d-4843-982f-31b5855d8d06 -->

Summary : This illustration shows a hydraulic system with two connected cylinders of different cross-sectional areas, each fitted with a piston and subjected to different forces.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The system consists of two vertical cylinders connected at the base, forming a U-shape filled with liquid.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with piston area "A" and force "F" applied downward.
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area "a" and force "f" applied downward.
  • Both pistons are shown pressing down on the liquid, with the liquid level equal in both arms.
  • The diagram is labeled "شكل ۲" (Figure 2 in Persian/Arabic numerals).

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or magnification is present.
  • The pistons are depicted as flat, circular disks fitting tightly in their respective cylinders.
  • The liquid is shown as a uniform blue fill, indicating an incompressible fluid.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The larger cylinder (left) and smaller cylinder (right) are connected at the base, allowing pressure transmission.
  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.
  • The force F is applied to the larger piston (area A), and force f is applied to the smaller piston (area a).

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually demonstrates Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The system suggests that the ratio of forces to areas (F/A = f/a) is key to the hydraulic mechanism.
  • The equal liquid levels indicate static equilibrium, with forces balanced according to the areas of the pistons. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.061,t=0.476,r=0.270,b=0.615), with ID 198b481d-93d0-49ab-a775-804cefef32a5 -->

Summary : This figure illustrates the different equilibrium states of a hydraulic piston system, showing the relationship between force, area, and pressure when the pistons are at the same or different levels, with corresponding equations.

diagram:
# Title & Layout :
  • Title (top right): "حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار" ("Hydraulic piston states at equilibrium").
  • Three side-by-side schematic diagrams, each with a descriptive heading.
  • Left and center: "المكبان في مستويين مختلفين" ("Pistons at different levels").
  • Right: "المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي" ("Pistons at the same horizontal level").

# Diagrams & Labels :
  • Each diagram shows a U-shaped tube filled with liquid, with two pistons (labeled 1 and 2) of different areas (a and A) and forces (f and F) applied.
  • Left and center diagrams: Pistons are at different heights, with a height difference h marked.
  • Right diagram: Pistons are at the same horizontal level.
  • All diagrams label the forces (f, F), areas (a, A), and height difference (h) where applicable.

# Equations :
  • Left and center diagrams (different levels): 
    - "P₁ = P₂"
    - "f/a = F/A + ρgh"
    - "f/a + ρgh = F/A"
  • Right diagram (same level): 
    - "P₁ = P₂"
    - "f/a = F/A"
  • ρ (rho) denotes fluid density, g is gravitational acceleration, h is height difference.

# Analysis :
  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the pressure ratio equals the force-to-area ratio (f/a = F/A).
  • When pistons are at different levels, the pressure difference due to the height of the fluid column (ρgh) must be considered, modifying the force-area relationship.
  • The diagrams and equations together clarify how hydraulic equilibrium depends on both piston area and height difference in the fluid. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID 4ce32fe7-10e4-4baa-82ad-6632f5b493b0 -->
