difference h marked.\n  • Right diagram: Pistons are at the same horizontal level.\n  • All diagrams label the forces (f, F), areas (a, A), and height difference (h) where applicable.\n\n# Equations :\n  • Left and center diagrams (different levels): \n    - \"P₁ = P₂\"\n    - \"f/a = F/A + ρgh\"\n    - \"f/a + ρgh = F/A\"\n  • Right diagram (same level): \n    - \"P₁ = P₂\"\n    - \"f/a = F/A\"\n  • ρ (rho) denotes fluid density, g is gravitational acceleration, h is height difference.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the pressure ratio equals the force-to-area ratio (f/a = F/A).\n  • When pistons are at different levels, the pressure difference due to the height of the fluid column (ρgh) must be considered, modifying the force-area relationship.\n  • The diagrams and equations together clarify how hydraulic equilibrium depends on both piston area and height difference in the fluid. <!-- figure, from page 0

transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.\n  • The difference in piston areas (A > a) implies that the forces F and f are related by the ratio of the areas (F/A = f/a).\n  • The equal fluid levels indicate the system is in static equilibrium. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.472,r=0.278,b=0.611), with ID 9557dd18-d16f-4cc6-9243-e293c8318f94 -->\n\n- لكي يعود المكبسان في مستوي أفقي

pressure at the bottom of both sides is set equal: P₁ = P₂.\n  • The pressure equation is: (f/a) = (F/A) + ρgh, where ρ is the liquid density and g is gravitational acceleration.\n  • The left and center panels differ only in the direction of the applied force and the reference points for the height \"h\".\n\n# Right Panel: Pistons at the Same Level :\n  • Shows a U-shaped tube with pistons 1 and 2 at the same horizontal level.\n  • Forces \"f\" and \"F\" are applied to pistons 1 and 2, respectively.\n  • The pressure at the bottom of both sides is equal: P₁ = P₂.\n  • The pressure equation simplifies to: (f/a) = (F/A), since the height difference is zero.\n\n# Headings and Labels :\n  • Top left and center: \"المكبسـان في مستويين مختلفين\" (\"The pistons at different levels\").\n  • Top right: \"المكبسـان في نفس المستـوى الأفقي\" (\"The pistons at the same horizontal level\").\n  • Each panel includes schematic diagrams, force labels (f, F), area labels (a, A), and pressure equations.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • When the pistons are at different heights, the pressure applied to the smaller piston must overcome both the force on the larger piston and the hydrostatic pressure due to the height difference (ρgh).\n  • When the pistons are at the same level, the pressure relationship depends only on the ratio of the applied forces to their respective areas.\n  • The diagrams visually reinforce Pascal's principle and the effect of hydrostatic pressure in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.651,r=0.888,b=0.892), with ID
