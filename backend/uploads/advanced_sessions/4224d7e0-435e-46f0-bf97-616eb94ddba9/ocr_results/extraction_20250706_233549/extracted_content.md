Hydraulic System Components :
  • Two vertical cylinders connected by a U-shaped tube filled with liquid (labeled "السانل الهيدروليكي" meaning "hydraulic fluid").
  • Left cylinder: large piston (area A) with upward force F applied.
  • Right cylinder: small piston (area a) with downward force f applied.

Labels & Annotations :
  • Left piston: labeled "A" (area), "F" (force), and vertical distance "y2".
  • Right piston: labeled "a" (area), "f" (force), and vertical distance "y1".
  • The liquid level is higher on the left side, indicating pressure transmission.
  • Figure caption: "شكل (1)" meaning "Figure (1)".
  • Section title: "الدرس الخامس" meaning "Lesson Five".

Spatial Relationships :
  • The two pistons are at different heights, with the left piston higher than the right.
  • The U-tube connects the two cylinders, allowing pressure to be transmitted through the fluid.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains how a small force applied to a small-area piston (right) can be transformed into a larger force on a larger-area piston (left) via hydraulic fluid, demonstrating Pascal's principle and mechanical advantage in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.064,t=0.061,r=0.415,b=0.252), with ID dd132c11-dd1d-493d-afba-9e403ae68d63 -->

Summary : This illustration demonstrates the principle of hydraulic systems, showing how a force applied to a larger piston (A) is transmitted through an incompressible fluid to a smaller piston (a), resulting in a different force output.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Two vertical cylinders of different diameters are connected at the base by a U-shaped tube filled with liquid.
  • The left cylinder (larger) is labeled "A" with a piston on top, and a downward force "F" is applied.
  • The right cylinder (smaller) is labeled "a" with a piston on top, and a downward force "f" is applied.
  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.
  • The diagram is labeled "شكل ۲" (Figure 2 in Persian) at the bottom.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or units are provided.
  • The pistons are shown as flat disks fitting tightly in their respective cylinders.
  • The forces "F" and "f" are indicated by downward arrows.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The larger piston (A) is on the left, the smaller piston (a) is on the right.
  • The liquid connects both pistons, allowing force transmission.
  • The dashed line indicates equal liquid levels, signifying pressure balance.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The difference in piston areas (A > a) means the forces (F and f) are related by the ratio of their areas, illustrating mechanical advantage in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.472,r=0.278,b=0.611), with ID 08c71323-d313-4c61-bf1c-7f5065687c54 -->

Summary : This figure compares the pressure relationships in hydraulic systems with pistons at different levels, illustrating the effect of height difference on pressure transmission and the resulting equations.

illustration:
# Left Panel: Pistons at Different Levels (Piston 2 Higher)
  • Shows a U-shaped tube with two pistons: piston 1 (area a, force f) at a lower level, piston 2 (area A, force F) at a higher level (height difference h).
  • The pressure at both pistons is set equal: P₁ = P₂.
  • The pressure equation is: f/a = F/A + ρgh, where ρ is fluid density and g is gravitational acceleration.

# Middle Panel: Pistons at Different Levels (Piston 1 Higher)
  • Similar U-tube, but piston 1 is now at a higher level than piston 2 (height difference h).
  • The pressure at both pistons is set equal: P₁ = P₂.
  • The pressure equation is: f/a + ρgh = F/A.

# Right Panel: Pistons at the Same Level
  • U-shaped tube with both pistons at the same horizontal level.
  • The pressure at both pistons is set equal: P₁ = P₂.
  • The pressure equation is: f/a = F/A.

# Headings and Labels:
  • Top left and middle: "المكبسـان في مستويين مختلفين" ("The pistons at different levels").
  • Top right: "المكبسـان في نفس المستـوى الأفقي" ("The pistons at the same horizontal level").
  • Each panel includes labeled forces (f, F), areas (a, A), and height difference (h).

# Analysis :
  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at different heights, the pressure transmission between them is affected by the hydrostatic pressure term (ρgh), which must be added or subtracted depending on which piston is higher.
  • When pistons are at the same level, the pressure relationship simplifies to a direct ratio of forces to areas (f/a = F/A), illustrating Pascal's principle in its simplest form.
  • The equations visually reinforce the importance of height differences in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.651,r=0.888,b=0.892), with ID b0f8149f-2211-419a-8e5c-6babf5a35795 -->
