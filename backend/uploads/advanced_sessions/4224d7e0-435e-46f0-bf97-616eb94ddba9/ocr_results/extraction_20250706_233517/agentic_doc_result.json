indicating ongoing maintenance or repair work.\n\nphoto:\nScene Overview :\n  • Main subject: Two white cars in a modern automotive repair workshop.\n  • Setting: Indoor garage with high ceilings, fluorescent lighting, and visible workshop equipment.\n  • Perspective: Angled side view showing both vehicles, with the elevated car in the foreground and the other car behind it.\n  • Composition: The elevated car dominates the upper right, while the grounded car is positioned lower left.\n  • Lighting: Bright, even illumination from overhead fluorescent lights.\n  • Colour palette: Predominantly neutral tones (white, grey, metallic), with some red accents (e.g., KIA post).\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No visible scale bar or measurement references.\n  • The elevated car is missing all four wheels, exposing brake rotors and suspension components.\n  • The grounded car has its hood open, suggesting engine or electrical work.\n  • Workshop equipment includes tool cabinets, a waste bin, and a portable diagnostic or charging unit.\n  • A red post with the KIA logo is visible, indicating possible brand affiliation.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The elevated car is positioned on a two-post hydraulic lift, raised above head height.\n  • The grounded car is parallel to the lift, with its front facing the viewer.\n  • Workshop tools and equipment are arranged along the back wall, with clear workspaces around both vehicles.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The image visually communicates a professional automotive service environment, highlighting both undercarriage and engine maintenance activities.\n  • The absence of wheels on the elevated car suggests brake, suspension, or drivetrain work.\n  • The open hood on the grounded car indicates simultaneous multi-point servicing.\n  • The presence of KIA branding suggests a dealership or authorised service centre. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.000,t=0.004,r=0.997,b=0.397), with ID

glass container (إناء زجاجي), with pressure and height variables annotated in Arabic.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • The main subject is a vertical cylindrical glass container filled with liquid.\n  • A piston (مكبس) is fitted at the top, pressing down on the liquid.\n  • The piston is labeled with the external pressure Pa (ضغط خارجي).\n  • The liquid column beneath the piston is labeled with height h (ارتفاع السائل).\n  • The pressure at a point A at the bottom of the liquid is labeled P(مكبس).\n  • The container is labeled as \"إناء زجاجي\" (glass vessel), and the liquid is labeled \"سائل\" (liquid).\n  • The illustration uses arrows to indicate the direction of pressure applied by the piston.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No scale bar or magnification is present.\n  • All labels are in Arabic.\n  • The diagram is schematic, not to scale.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The piston is at the top, in direct contact with the liquid surface.\n  • The height h is measured vertically from the piston to point A at the bottom.\n  • Pressure is shown as acting downward from the piston and at the bottom point A.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration visually explains the concept of pressure transmission in a liquid under a piston, likely for a physics or fluid mechanics context.\n  • It demonstrates how external pressure (Pa) and the height of the liquid (h) relate to the pressure at a point (A) at the bottom of the container. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.049,t=0.542,r=0.252,b=0.689), with ID d220e421-c9ce-4641-b976-ad66ef60eebf -->\n\n$P = P_a +

depicted in a cross-sectional side view, with clear labeling of all parts in Arabic.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • The external pressure above the piston is labeled as Pa.\n  • The pressure at a depth h below the piston is labeled as P(عندعمق), meaning \"pressure at depth\".\n  • The depth from the piston to a point A in the liquid is marked as h.\n  • The point A is indicated at the bottom of the liquid column.\n  • All labels are in Arabic script.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The piston sits horizontally at the top of the liquid, with the weight directly above it.\n  • The arrows show pressure being transmitted downward from the piston to the liquid.\n  • The depth h is measured vertically from the piston surface to point A at the bottom.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration visually explains how pressure is applied to a liquid in a closed container and how it increases with depth (h).\n  • The labeled pressures and depth highlight the principle that pressure at a point in a liquid depends on both the external pressure and the depth below the surface. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.050,t=0.708,r=0.240,b=0.869), with ID eb3f5543-7ea9-4ee4-a13a-e5f884f09b84 -->\n\n$P =
