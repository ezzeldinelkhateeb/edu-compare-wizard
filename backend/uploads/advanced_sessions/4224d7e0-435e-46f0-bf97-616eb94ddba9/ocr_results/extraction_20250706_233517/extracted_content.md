Summary : This image shows a car repair workshop with two white vehicles, one elevated on a hydraulic lift with its wheels removed, and another on the ground with its hood open, indicating ongoing maintenance or repair work.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject: Two white cars in a modern automotive repair workshop.
  • Setting: Indoor garage with high ceilings, fluorescent lighting, and visible workshop equipment.
  • Perspective: Angled side view showing both vehicles, with the elevated car in the foreground and the other car behind it.
  • Composition: The elevated car dominates the upper right, while the grounded car is positioned lower left.
  • Lighting: Bright, even illumination from overhead fluorescent lights.
  • Colour palette: Predominantly neutral tones (white, grey, metallic), with some red accents (e.g., KIA post).

Technical Details :
  • No visible scale bar or measurement references.
  • The elevated car is missing all four wheels, exposing brake rotors and suspension components.
  • The grounded car has its hood open, suggesting engine or electrical work.
  • Workshop equipment includes tool cabinets, a waste bin, and a portable diagnostic or charging unit.
  • A red post with the KIA logo is visible, indicating possible brand affiliation.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The elevated car is positioned on a two-post hydraulic lift, raised above head height.
  • The grounded car is parallel to the lift, with its front facing the viewer.
  • Workshop tools and equipment are arranged along the back wall, with clear workspaces around both vehicles.

Analysis :
  • The image visually communicates a professional automotive service environment, highlighting both undercarriage and engine maintenance activities.
  • The absence of wheels on the elevated car suggests brake, suspension, or drivetrain work.
  • The open hood on the grounded car indicates simultaneous multi-point servicing.
  • The presence of KIA branding suggests a dealership or authorised service centre. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.000,t=0.004,r=0.997,b=0.397), with ID 8463a337-4f41-400c-a985-73ac4ef6ab4c -->

Summary : This is a labeled scientific illustration showing a piston (مكبس) pressing down on a liquid inside a glass container (إناء زجاجي), with pressure and height variables annotated in Arabic.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a vertical cylindrical glass container filled with liquid.
  • A piston (مكبس) is fitted at the top, pressing down on the liquid.
  • The piston is labeled with the external pressure Pa (ضغط خارجي).
  • The liquid column beneath the piston is labeled with height h (ارتفاع السائل).
  • The pressure at a point A at the bottom of the liquid is labeled P(مكبس).
  • The container is labeled as "إناء زجاجي" (glass vessel), and the liquid is labeled "سائل" (liquid).
  • The illustration uses arrows to indicate the direction of pressure applied by the piston.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or magnification is present.
  • All labels are in Arabic.
  • The diagram is schematic, not to scale.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The piston is at the top, in direct contact with the liquid surface.
  • The height h is measured vertically from the piston to point A at the bottom.
  • Pressure is shown as acting downward from the piston and at the bottom point A.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains the concept of pressure transmission in a liquid under a piston, likely for a physics or fluid mechanics context.
  • It demonstrates how external pressure (Pa) and the height of the liquid (h) relate to the pressure at a point (A) at the bottom of the container. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.049,t=0.542,r=0.252,b=0.689), with ID d220e421-c9ce-4641-b976-ad66ef60eebf -->

Summary : This is a labeled scientific illustration showing a piston-cylinder apparatus used to demonstrate pressure in a liquid, with Arabic annotations for each component.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a vertical glass container (إناء زجاجي) filled with liquid (سائل), with a movable piston (مكبس) and a weight (ثقل) placed on top.
  • The piston is shown pressing down on the liquid, with arrows indicating the direction of applied pressure.
  • The setup is depicted in a cross-sectional side view, with clear labeling of all parts in Arabic.

Technical Details :
  • The external pressure above the piston is labeled as Pa.
  • The pressure at a depth h below the piston is labeled as P(عندعمق), meaning "pressure at depth".
  • The depth from the piston to a point A in the liquid is marked as h.
  • The point A is indicated at the bottom of the liquid column.
  • All labels are in Arabic script.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The piston sits horizontally at the top of the liquid, with the weight directly above it.
  • The arrows show pressure being transmitted downward from the piston to the liquid.
  • The depth h is measured vertically from the piston surface to point A at the bottom.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains how pressure is applied to a liquid in a closed container and how it increases with depth (h).
  • The labeled pressures and depth highlight the principle that pressure at a point in a liquid depends on both the external pressure and the depth below the surface. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.050,t=0.708,r=0.240,b=0.869), with ID eb3f5543-7ea9-4ee4-a13a-e5f884f09b84 -->
