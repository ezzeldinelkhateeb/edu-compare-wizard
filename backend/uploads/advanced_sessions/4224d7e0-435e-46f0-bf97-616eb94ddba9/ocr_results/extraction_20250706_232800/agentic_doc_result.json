positioned on hydraulic lifts for maintenance or inspection.\n\nphoto:\nScene Overview :\n  • The main subject is a spacious, well-lit automotive workshop with a high ceiling and large windows.\n  • Several cars of various colors (silver, orange, red, blue, black) are visible, with some elevated on blue hydraulic lifts and others parked on the ground.\n  • The perspective is from ground level, looking diagonally across the workshop, capturing both foreground and background vehicles.\n  • Lighting is bright and diffuse, likely from natural daylight through the large windows and overhead artificial lights.\n  • The color palette is dominated by the vibrant hues of the cars and the blue of the lift structures.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No visible scale bar or measurement references.\n  • No on-image text, UI elements, or labels.\n  • The hydraulic lifts are two-post types, painted blue, supporting cars at varying heights.\n  • The workshop floor is marked with yellow lines, likely indicating parking or work zones.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • In the foreground, a silver car is elevated on a lift, with an orange car parked directly beneath it.\n  • In the midground, another orange car is raised, with a black car parked below.\n  • Additional cars are visible in the background, some on lifts and others on the ground, arranged in parallel rows.\n  • The composition uses depth, with cars and lifts receding into the background, emphasizing the scale of the facility.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The image conveys a sense of organization and efficiency typical of a professional automotive service center.\n  • The use of hydraulic lifts allows for vertical stacking of vehicles, maximizing workspace.\n  • The bright, clean environment suggests a modern, well-maintained facility.\n  • The variety of car colors and models indicates a general-purpose workshop rather than a brand-specific service center. <!-- figure, from page 0

Arabic labels indicating pressure, height, and area.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • The main subject is a vertical cylindrical glass container filled with liquid.\n  • A piston (مكبس) is placed at the top, pressing down on the liquid.\n  • The piston is labeled with the external pressure (Pa).\n  • The liquid surface is labeled as \"سائل\" (liquid).\n  • The container is labeled as \"إناء زجاجي\" (glass vessel).\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • The height from the piston to a point A at the bottom of the liquid is marked as \"h\".\n  • The pressure at point A is labeled as \"P (مكبس)\".\n  • The area at the bottom is labeled as \"A\".\n  • All labels are in Arabic.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The piston is at the top, pressing vertically downward.\n  • The height \"h\" is measured vertically from the piston to the bottom point A.\n  • The area \"A\" is at the base of the liquid column.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration visually explains the concept of pressure transmission in a liquid under a piston, showing how external pressure and liquid column height relate to the pressure at a specific point at the bottom. <!-- figure, from page 0

pressure (possibly from a piston), and the hydrostatic pressure due to fluid height.\n\nequation:\n  Components :\n    • P = Pa + P(مكبس) + ρgh\n    • Pa: Atmospheric pressure.\n    • P(مكبس): Pressure from a piston (Arabic: مكبس).\n    • ρgh: Hydrostatic pressure term, where ρ is fluid density, g is gravitational acceleration, and h is height.\n  Notation & Language :\n    • Uses both Latin and Arabic script for variable labels.\n    • All terms are summed to yield total pressure P.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The equation expresses that total pressure at a point in a fluid is the sum of atmospheric pressure, any additional applied pressure (such as from a piston), and the pressure due to the weight of the fluid column above that point. <!-- figure, from page 0

illustration showing a piston-cylinder apparatus used to demonstrate pressure in a liquid, with Arabic annotations for each component.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • The main subject is a vertical glass container (إناء زجاجي) filled with liquid (سائل), with a movable piston (مكبس) and a weight (ثقل) placed on top.\n  • The piston is shown pressing down on the liquid, with arrows indicating the direction of applied pressure.\n  • The setup is depicted in a simple, schematic style with clear labeling.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • The piston is labeled with atmospheric pressure (Pa) and the pressure exerted by the piston (P(مكبس)).\n  • The height of the liquid column beneath the piston is marked as \"h\".\n  • The point at the bottom of the liquid is labeled \"A\".\n  • All labels are in Arabic script.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The piston sits horizontally at the top of the liquid, with the weight directly above it.\n  • The pressure arrows point vertically downward from the piston to the liquid surface and further down to point A at the bottom.\n  • The height \"h\" is measured vertically from the piston to point A.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration visually explains how pressure is transmitted through a liquid by a piston and weight, with clear indication of pressure points and height, suitable for educational purposes in fluid mechanics. <!--
