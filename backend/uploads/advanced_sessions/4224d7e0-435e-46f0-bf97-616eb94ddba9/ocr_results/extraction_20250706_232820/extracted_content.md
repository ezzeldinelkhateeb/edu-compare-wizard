illustration:
# Diagram Overview :
  • Shows two vertical cylinders (pistons) connected at the base by a horizontal tube, all filled with a hydraulic fluid (labeled "السائل الهيدروليكي").
  • The left cylinder (large piston) has area A and is acted upon by an upward force F.
  • The right cylinder (small piston) has area a and is acted upon by a downward force f.
  • Heights y1 and y2 are marked for the fluid levels in each cylinder.
  • Arrows indicate the direction of applied forces (down on the small piston, up on the large piston).

# Equations and Labels :
  • Pressure under the small piston: P = f / a
  • Pressure under the large piston: P = F / A
  • The diagram is labeled as "شكل (1)" (Figure 1).

# Explanatory Text (Arabic, paraphrased) :
  • Describes that when the pistons are at the same horizontal level and a force f is applied to the small piston, a pressure P is generated under it.
  • This pressure is transmitted equally throughout the hydraulic fluid to the large piston, resulting in an upward force F.
  • The relationship between forces and areas is given by the pressure equations above.

# Analysis :
  • The illustration demonstrates Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The system amplifies force: a small force on the small piston (with small area) produces a larger force on the large piston (with large area), as shown by the proportionality in the equations. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID 96c0c06e-ebea-4e19-94c2-753d8859c92d -->

Summary : This illustration demonstrates the principle of hydraulic systems, showing how a force applied to a large piston is transmitted through a fluid to a smaller piston, resulting in a different force output.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The image shows two vertical cylinders of different diameters connected at the base by a U-shaped tube filled with liquid.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with piston area "A" and force "F" applied downward.
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area "a" and force "f" applied downward.
  • Both pistons are in contact with the liquid, and the liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.

Technical Details :
  • The pistons are depicted as flat, circular disks.
  • The liquid is shown as a uniform blue color, filling both cylinders and the connecting tube.
  • The forces "F" and "f" are indicated by downward arrows.
  • The labels "A" and "a" denote the cross-sectional areas of the pistons.
  • The diagram is labeled "شكل ۲" (Figure 2) in Persian at the bottom.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The larger piston (left) and smaller piston (right) are at the same vertical height, indicating equal pressure at the same depth.
  • The connecting tube ensures the fluid transmits pressure between the two pistons.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The system demonstrates how a small force applied to a small piston can balance a larger force on a larger piston if the ratio of forces equals the ratio of areas (F/A = f/a).
  • The equal liquid levels confirm the system is in static equilibrium. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.061,t=0.476,r=0.270,b=0.615), with ID 737d2a1f-740d-47b0-b883-1dc9827d98d3 -->

Summary : This figure illustrates the different equilibrium states of a hydraulic piston system, showing how the positions of the pistons (at the same or different levels) affect the pressure relationships and force equations.

# Title & Layout :  
  • Title at top: "حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار" ("States of the Hydraulic Piston at Equilibrium").  
  • Three side-by-side schematic diagrams, each showing a U-shaped hydraulic system with two pistons labeled 1 and 2, with forces applied (f, F) and areas (a, A).  
  • Each diagram is accompanied by equations and Arabic text describing the scenario.

# Left Panel – Pistons at Different Levels (المكبان في مستويين مختلفين) :  
  • Left piston (1) is higher than right piston (2) by height h.  
  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F applied to piston 2 (area A).  
  • Fluid level under piston 1 is at height h above piston 2.  
  • Equation:  
    - \( P_1 = P_2 \)  
    - \( \frac{f}{a} = \frac{F}{A} + \rho g h \)

# Middle Panel – Pistons at Different Levels (المكبان في مستويين مختلفين) :  
  • Right piston (2) is higher than left piston (1) by height h (opposite of left panel).  
  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F applied to piston 2 (area A).  
  • Fluid level under piston 2 is at height h above piston 1.  
  • Equation:  
    - \( P_1 = P_2 \)  
    - \( \frac{f}{a} + \rho g h = \frac{F}{A} \)

# Right Panel – Pistons at Same Level (المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي) :  
  • Both pistons at the same horizontal level.  
  • Forces f and F applied to pistons 1 and 2, with areas a and A, respectively.  
  • Fluid levels are equal under both pistons.  
  • Equation:  
    - \( P_1 = P_2 \)  
    - \( \frac{f}{a} = \frac{F}{A} \)

# Design Encodings :  
  • Schematic diagrams use simple line drawings with labeled pistons, forces, and fluid heights.  
  • Equations are written below each diagram.  
  • Arabic text provides scenario descriptions above each panel.

# Analysis :  
  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at different heights, the pressure balance includes a hydrostatic term (\( \rho g h \)), while at the same level, the force-to-area ratios are directly equal.  
  • The direction of the hydrostatic term depends on which piston is higher.  
  • This visualisation clarifies the effect of piston height difference on hydraulic equilibrium. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID 5d34959e-5c7b-4ba6-af24-90e15e488e8c -->
