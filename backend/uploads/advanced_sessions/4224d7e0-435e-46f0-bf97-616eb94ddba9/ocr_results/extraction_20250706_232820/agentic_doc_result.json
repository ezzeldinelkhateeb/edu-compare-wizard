and equations.\n\nillustration:\n# Diagram Overview :\n  • Shows two vertical cylinders (pistons) connected at the base by a horizontal tube, all filled with a hydraulic fluid (labeled \"السائل الهيدروليكي\").\n  • The left cylinder (large piston) has area A and is acted upon by an upward force F.\n  • The right cylinder (small piston) has area a and is acted upon by a downward force f.\n  • Heights y1 and y2 are marked for the fluid levels in each cylinder.\n  • Arrows indicate the direction of applied forces (down on the small piston, up on the large piston).\n\n# Equations and Labels :\n  • Pressure under the small piston: P = f / a\n  • Pressure under the large piston: P = F / A\n  • The diagram is labeled as \"شكل (1)\" (Figure 1).\n\n# Explanatory Text (Arabic, paraphrased) :\n  • Describes that when the pistons are at the same horizontal level and a force f is applied to the small piston, a pressure P is generated under it.\n  • This pressure is transmitted equally throughout the hydraulic fluid to the large piston, resulting in an upward force F.\n  • The relationship between forces and areas is given by the pressure equations above.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The illustration demonstrates Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.\n  • The system amplifies force: a small force on the small piston (with small area) produces a larger force on the large piston (with large area), as shown by the proportionality in the equations. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID

Title & Layout :  \n  • Title at top: \"حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار\" (\"States of the Hydraulic Piston at Equilibrium\").  \n  • Three side-by-side schematic diagrams, each showing a U-shaped hydraulic system with two pistons labeled 1 and 2, with forces applied (f, F) and areas (a, A).  \n  • Each diagram is accompanied by equations and Arabic text describing the scenario.\n\n# Left Panel – Pistons at Different Levels (المكبان في مستويين مختلفين) :  \n  • Left piston (1) is higher than right piston (2) by height h.  \n  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F applied to piston 2 (area A).  \n  • Fluid level under piston 1 is at height h above piston 2.  \n  • Equation:  \n    - \\( P_1 = P_2 \\)  \n    - \\( \\frac{f}{a} = \\frac{F}{A} + \\rho g h \\)\n\n# Middle Panel – Pistons at Different Levels (المكبان في مستويين مختلفين) :  \n  • Right piston (2) is higher than left piston (1) by height h (opposite of left panel).  \n  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F applied to piston 2 (area A).  \n  • Fluid level under piston 2 is at height h above piston 1.  \n  • Equation:  \n    - \\( P_1 = P_2 \\)  \n    - \\( \\frac{f}{a} + \\rho g h = \\frac{F}{A} \\)\n\n# Right Panel – Pistons at Same Level (المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي) :  \n  • Both pistons at the same horizontal level.  \n  • Forces f and F applied to pistons 1 and 2, with areas a and A, respectively.  \n  • Fluid levels are equal under both pistons.  \n  • Equation:  \n    - \\( P_1 = P_2 \\)  \n    - \\( \\frac{f}{a} = \\frac{F}{A} \\)\n\n# Design Encodings :  \n  • Schematic diagrams use simple line drawings with labeled pistons, forces, and fluid heights.  \n  • Equations are written below each diagram.  \n  • Arabic text provides scenario descriptions above each panel.\n\n# Analysis :  \n  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at different heights, the pressure balance includes a hydrostatic term (\\( \\rho g h \\)), while at the same level, the force-to-area ratios are directly equal.  \n  • The direction of the hydrostatic term depends on which piston is higher.  \n  • This visualisation clarifies the effect of piston height difference on hydraulic equilibrium. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID 5d34959e-5c7b-4ba6-af24-90e15e488e8c -->\n\nحيث : (ρ) كثافة السائل ، (h) ارتفاع عمود السائل بين المكبسين.

      "text": "Summary : This figure illustrates the different equilibrium states of a hydraulic piston system, showing how the positions of the pistons (at the same or different levels) affect the pressure relationships and force equations.\n\ndiagram:  \n# Title & Layout :  \n  • Title at top: \"حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار\" (\"States of the Hydraulic Piston at Equilibrium\").  \n  • Three side-by-side schematic diagrams, each showing a U-shaped hydraulic system with two pistons labeled 1 and 2, with forces applied (f, F) and areas (a, A).  \n  • Each diagram is accompanied by equations and Arabic text describing the scenario.\n\n# Left Panel – Pistons at Different Levels (المكبان في مستويين مختلفين) :  \n  • Left piston (1) is higher than right piston (2) by height h.  \n  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F applied to piston 2 (area A).  \n  • Fluid level under piston 1 is at height h above piston 2.  \n  • Equation:  \n    - \\( P_1 = P_2 \\)  \n    - \\( \\frac{f}{a} = \\frac{F}{A} + \\rho g h \\)\n\n# Middle Panel – Pistons at Different Levels (المكبان في مستويين مختلفين) :  \n  • Right piston (2) is higher than left piston (1) by height h (opposite of left panel).  \n  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F applied to piston 2 (area A).  \n  • Fluid level under piston 2 is at height h above piston 1.  \n  • Equation:  \n    - \\( P_1 = P_2 \\)  \n    - \\( \\frac{f}{a} + \\rho g h = \\frac{F}{A} \\)\n\n# Right Panel – Pistons at Same Level (المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي) :  \n  • Both pistons at the same horizontal level.  \n  • Forces f and F applied to pistons 1 and 2, with areas a and A, respectively.  \n  • Fluid levels are equal under both pistons.  \n  • Equation:  \n    - \\( P_1 = P_2 \\)  \n    - \\( \\frac{f}{a} = \\frac{F}{A} \\)\n\n# Design Encodings :  \n  • Schematic diagrams use simple line drawings with labeled pistons, forces, and fluid heights.  \n  • Equations are written below each diagram.  \n  • Arabic text provides scenario descriptions above each panel.\n\n# Analysis :  \n  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at different heights, the pressure balance includes a hydrostatic term (\\( \\rho g h \\)), while at the same level, the force-to-area ratios are directly equal.  \n  • The direction of the hydrostatic term depends on which piston is higher.  \n  • This visualisation clarifies the effect of piston height difference on hydraulic equilibrium.",
