Summary : This is a physics illustration showing a U-shaped tube with two pistons of different areas, accompanied by a multiple-choice question about the ratio of pressures at the large and small pistons.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The image shows a U-shaped tube filled with liquid.
  • The left side has a large piston labeled with area "2A" and an upward force "F".
  • The right side has a smaller piston labeled with area "A" and an upward force "f".
  • Both pistons are at the same horizontal level, marked "A".

Technical Details :
  • The left piston has twice the area of the right piston.
  • The forces and areas are clearly labeled.
  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The large piston (2A) is on the left, the small piston (A) is on the right.
  • Both pistons are pushing up on the liquid.

Question and Choices :
  • The question asks: "In the adjacent figure, the ratio of the pressure at the large piston to the pressure at the small piston is ...."
  • Four answer choices are provided:
    1. 1/1 (circled)
    2. 1/2
    3. 2/1
    4. Cannot be determined

Analysis :
  • The illustration is designed to test understanding of pressure transmission in fluids (Pascal's principle).
  • The key visual message is the comparison of pressures at pistons of different areas but at the same height in a connected fluid system. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.077,t=0.056,r=0.928,b=0.196), with ID 4257f6e3-c6e0-4158-8695-38067c466cc9 -->

Summary : The figure presents four different graphs, each illustrating a possible relationship between the displacement of a large hydraulic piston (y₂) and the displacement of a small piston (y₁), with both axes labeled and the same scale used for both quantities. The question asks which graph best represents the relationship between these two displacements.

line plots:
Title & Axes :
  • No explicit title on the figure, but the context is the relationship between the displacement of a large hydraulic piston (y₂) and a small piston (y₁).
  • X-axis: y₁ (displacement of the small piston).
  • Y-axis: y₂ (displacement of the large piston).
  • Both axes are labeled in Arabic as y₁ and y₂, with positive direction indicated by arrows.
  • No tick labels or numeric values shown.

Panels & Curves :
  • Four panels labeled (أ), (ب), (ج), (د) from right to left.
  • (أ): Upward-sloping straight line from origin (linear, positive slope).
  • (ب): Upward-sloping straight line from origin, steeper than (أ).
  • (ج): Downward-sloping curve, concave down, starting high on y₂-axis and approaching x-axis as y₁ increases (hyperbolic-like).
  • (د): Downward-sloping curve, concave up, starting high on y₂-axis and approaching x-axis as y₁ increases (inverse relationship).

Design Encodings :
  • All curves are drawn in red.
  • Axes are blue with arrowheads.
  • Each panel is encircled and labeled with an Arabic letter.

Analysis :
  • The four graphs offer different mathematical relationships: (أ) and (ب) are linear with positive slopes, while (ج) and (د) are nonlinear, showing inverse relationships.
  • The question context (hydraulic pistons) suggests an inverse relationship between the displacements, which is visually represented in panels (ج) and (د).
  • The figure is designed to test understanding of the physical relationship between piston displacements in a hydraulic system. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.071,t=0.198,r=0.925,b=0.388), with ID 7893b42f-de08-4861-884a-faf05185d426 -->

Summary : This is a physics illustration and multiple-choice question about a hydraulic press containing a liquid of density ρ, with two pistons of areas A and 3A. A mass m is placed on the larger piston, and the question asks for the value of m in terms of ρ, h, and A, given the system is in equilibrium.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Schematic diagram of a U-shaped hydraulic press with two pistons.
  • Left piston (smaller) has area A and is at height h above the liquid.
  • Right piston (larger) has area 3A and supports a mass m.
  • Both pistons are shown at equilibrium, with the liquid level equal on both sides except for the height h on the left.

Technical Details :
  • The liquid has density ρ.
  • The height difference between the pistons is labeled h.
  • The area of the left piston is A; the area of the right piston is 3A.
  • The mass m is placed on the larger piston.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The left piston is higher than the right by a vertical distance h.
  • The mass m is only on the right (larger) piston.

Question and Choices :
  • The question asks: "If the system is in equilibrium, what is the value of the mass m placed on the larger piston?"
  • Four answer choices are given:
    – m = ρhA
    – m = 2ρhA
    – m = 3ρhA
    – m = 4ρhA

Analysis :
  • The diagram visually represents Pascal's principle and the equilibrium of forces in a hydraulic press.
  • The key variables are the density ρ, height h, and piston areas A and 3A.
  • The answer choices reflect different possible values for the mass m required to balance the pressure difference due to the height h of the liquid column. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.646,r=0.926,b=0.778), with ID b6ec088e-de87-4625-989e-b997d37d772a -->

Summary : This is a physics illustration and multiple-choice question about a hydraulic press system, showing two pistons of different areas connected by a fluid, with weights placed on each piston. The question asks for the value of the larger mass (M) required for equilibrium, given the smaller mass (m) and the area ratio.

illustration:
# Hydraulic Press System :
  • Diagram shows two vertical pistons connected at the base by a tube filled with hydraulic fluid.
  • Left piston (smaller) labeled with mass m and area a.
  • Right piston (larger) labeled with mass M and area 10a.
  • Both pistons are shown pressing down on the fluid, with the fluid level equal in both containers.
  • The system is labeled "سائل هيدروليكي" (hydraulic fluid).

# Question Text (in Arabic) :
  • States that the small piston has area a and mass m, the large piston has area 10a and mass M.
  • Asks: When the pistons are in horizontal equilibrium and their own masses are neglected, what is the value of M in terms of m?
  • Four answer choices are provided:
    1. M = m
    2. M = 10 m
    3. M = 100 m
    4. M = 150 m

# Analysis :
  • The illustration visually represents Pascal's principle in a hydraulic press.
  • The question tests understanding of force and area relationships in hydraulic systems.
  • The answer choices reflect different possible ratios for the required mass M to balance the system, based on the area ratio (10:1).
  • The correct answer (by the area ratio) is M = 10 m, matching the area ratio of the pistons. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.783,r=0.926,b=0.930), with ID c3f2479e-22ad-45cb-9ebd-82e55857e0a4 -->
