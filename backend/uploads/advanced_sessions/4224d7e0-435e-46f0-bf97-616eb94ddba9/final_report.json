(l=0.244,t=0.111,r=0.615,b=0.161), with ID 2d528bd4-af83-4fdd-ac50-d1ae35130fe8 -->\n\nSummary : This image shows the interior of an automotive workshop or service center, featuring multiple cars positioned on hydraulic lifts for maintenance or inspection.\n\nphoto:\nScene Overview :\n  • The main subject is a spacious, well-lit automotive workshop with a high ceiling and large windows.\n  • Several cars of various colors (silver, orange, red, blue, black) are visible, with some elevated on blue hydraulic lifts and others parked on the ground.\n  • The perspective is from ground level, looking diagonally across the workshop, capturing both foreground and background vehicles.\n  • Lighting is bright and diffuse, likely from natural daylight through the large windows and overhead artificial lights.\n  • The color palette is dominated by the vibrant hues of the cars and the blue of the lift structures.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No visible scale bar or measurement references.\n  • No on-image text, UI elements, or labels.\n  • The hydraulic lifts are two-post types, painted blue, supporting cars at varying heights.\n  • The workshop floor is marked with yellow lines, likely indicating parking or work zones.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • In the foreground, a silver car is elevated on a lift, with an orange car parked directly beneath it.\n  • In the midground, another orange car is raised, with a black car parked below.\n  • Additional cars are visible in the background, some on lifts and others on the ground, arranged in parallel rows.\n  • The composition uses depth, with cars and lifts receding into the background, emphasizing the scale of the facility.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The image conveys a sense of organization and efficiency typical of a professional automotive service center.\n  • The use of hydraulic lifts allows for vertical stacking of vehicles, maximizing workspace.\n  • The bright, clean environment suggests a modern, well-maintained facility.\n  • The variety of car colors and models indicates a general-purpose workshop rather than a brand-specific service center. <!-- figure, from page 0

Arabic labels indicating pressure, height, and area.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • The main subject is a vertical cylindrical glass container filled with liquid.\n  • A piston (مكبس) is placed at the top, pressing down on the liquid.\n  • The piston is labeled with the external pressure (Pa).\n  • The liquid surface is labeled as \"سائل\" (liquid).\n  • The container is labeled as \"إناء زجاجي\" (glass vessel).\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • The height from the piston to a point A at the bottom of the liquid is marked as \"h\".\n  • The pressure at point A is labeled as \"P (مكبس)\".\n  • The area at the bottom is labeled as \"A\".\n  • All labels are in Arabic.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The piston is at the top, pressing vertically downward.\n  • The height \"h\" is measured vertically from the piston to the bottom point A.\n  • The area \"A\" is at the base of the liquid column.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration visually explains the concept of pressure transmission in a liquid under a piston, showing how external pressure and liquid column height relate to the pressure at a specific point at the bottom. <!-- figure, from page 0

pressure (possibly from a piston), and the hydrostatic pressure due to fluid height.\n\nequation:\n  Components :\n    • P = Pa + P(مكبس) + ρgh\n    • Pa: Atmospheric pressure.\n    • P(مكبس): Pressure from a piston (Arabic: مكبس).\n    • ρgh: Hydrostatic pressure term, where ρ is fluid density, g is gravitational acceleration, and h is height.\n  Notation & Language :\n    • Uses both Latin and Arabic script for variable labels.\n    • All terms are summed to yield total pressure P.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The equation expresses that total pressure at a point in a fluid is the sum of atmospheric pressure, any additional applied pressure (such as from a piston), and the pressure due to the weight of the fluid column above that point. <!-- figure, from page 0

      "extracted_text": "Summary : This is a labeled scientific illustration explaining the operation of a hydraulic press using two connected pistons of different areas, accompanied by Arabic explanatory text and equations.\n\nillustration:\n# Diagram Overview :\n  • Shows two vertical cylinders (pistons) connected at the base by a horizontal tube, all filled with a hydraulic fluid (labeled \"السائل الهيدروليكي\").\n  • The left cylinder (large piston) has area A and is acted upon by an upward force F.\n  • The right cylinder (small piston) has area a and is acted upon by a downward force f.\n  • Heights y1 and y2 are marked for the fluid levels in each cylinder.\n  • Arrows indicate the direction of applied forces (down on the small piston, up on the large piston).\n\n# Equations and Labels :\n  • Pressure under the small piston: P = f / a\n  • Pressure under the large piston: P = F / A\n  • The diagram is labeled as \"شكل (1)\" (Figure 1).\n\n# Explanatory Text (Arabic, paraphrased) :\n  • Describes that when the pistons are at the same horizontal level and a force f is applied to the small piston, a pressure P is generated under it.\n  • This pressure is transmitted equally throughout the hydraulic fluid to the large piston, resulting in an upward force F.\n  • The relationship between forces and areas is given by the pressure equations above.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The illustration demonstrates Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.\n  • The system amplifies force: a small force on the small piston (with small area) produces a larger force on the large piston (with large area), as shown by the proportionality in the equations. <!-- figure, from page 0

the right side.\n  • All variables are presented in a serif font, centered within a bordered box.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The equation indicates that the ratio of A to a is equal to the ratio of y₁ to y₂,

large piston is transmitted through a fluid to a smaller piston, resulting in a different force output.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • The image shows two vertical cylinders of different diameters connected at the base by a U-shaped tube filled with liquid.\n  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with piston area \"A\" and force \"F\" applied downward.\n  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area \"a\" and force \"f\" applied downward.\n  • Both pistons are in contact with the liquid, and the liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • The pistons are depicted as flat, circular disks.\n  • The liquid is shown as a uniform blue color, filling both cylinders and the connecting tube.\n  • The forces \"F\" and \"f\" are indicated by downward arrows.\n  • The labels \"A\" and \"a\" denote the cross-sectional areas of the pistons.\n  • The diagram is labeled \"شكل ۲\" (Figure 2) in Persian at the bottom.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The larger piston (left) and smaller piston (right) are at the same vertical height, indicating equal pressure at the same depth.\n  • The connecting tube ensures the fluid transmits pressure between the two pistons.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.\n  • The system demonstrates how a small force applied to a small piston can balance a larger force on a larger piston if the ratio of forces equals the ratio of areas (F/A = f/a).\n  • The equal liquid levels confirm the system is in static equilibrium. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.061,t=0.476,r=0.270,b=0.615), with ID 737d2a1f-740d-47b0-b883-1dc9827d98d3 -->\n\n- لكي

-->\n\nSummary : This figure illustrates the different equilibrium states of a hydraulic piston system, showing how the positions of the pistons (at the same or different levels) affect the pressure relationships and force equations.\n\ndiagram:  \n# Title & Layout :  \n  • Title at top: \"حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار\" (\"States of the Hydraulic Piston at Equilibrium\").  \n  • Three side-by-side schematic diagrams, each showing a U-shaped hydraulic system with two pistons labeled 1 and 2, with forces applied (f, F) and areas (a, A).  \n  • Each diagram is accompanied by equations and Arabic text describing the scenario.\n\n# Left Panel – Pistons at Different Levels (المكبان في مستويين مختلفين) :  \n  • Left piston (1) is higher than right piston (2) by height h.  \n  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F applied to piston 2 (area A).  \n  • Fluid level under piston 1 is at height h above piston 2.  \n  • Equation:  \n    - \\( P_1 = P_2 \\)  \n    - \\( \\frac{f}{a} = \\frac{F}{A} + \\rho g h \\)\n\n# Middle Panel – Pistons at Different Levels (المكبان في مستويين مختلفين) :  \n  • Right piston (2) is higher than left piston (1) by height h (opposite of left panel).  \n  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F applied to piston 2 (area A).  \n  • Fluid level under piston 2 is at height h above piston 1.  \n  • Equation:  \n    - \\( P_1 = P_2 \\)  \n    - \\( \\frac{f}{a} + \\rho g h = \\frac{F}{A} \\)\n\n# Right Panel – Pistons at Same Level (المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي) :  \n  • Both pistons at the same horizontal level.  \n  • Forces f and F applied to pistons 1 and 2, with areas a and A, respectively.  \n  • Fluid levels are equal under both pistons.  \n  • Equation:  \n    - \\( P_1 = P_2 \\)  \n    - \\( \\frac{f}{a} = \\frac{F}{A} \\)\n\n# Design Encodings :  \n  • Schematic diagrams use simple line drawings with labeled pistons, forces, and fluid heights.  \n  • Equations are written below each diagram.  \n  • Arabic text provides scenario descriptions above each panel.\n\n# Analysis :  \n  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at different heights, the pressure balance includes a hydrostatic term (\\( \\rho g h \\)), while at the same level, the force-to-area ratios are directly equal.  \n  • The direction of the hydrostatic term depends on which piston is higher.  \n  • This visualisation clarifies the effect of piston height difference on hydraulic equilibrium. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID 5d34959e-5c7b-4ba6-af24-90e15e488e8c -->\n\nحيث : (ρ)

filled with liquid, with two pistons of different areas placed on each side, demonstrating the principle of hydraulic systems and Pascal's law.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • The main subject is a U-shaped vessel containing a liquid (likely oil or water), with two vertical arms of different diameters.\n  • Each arm has a piston: the left piston is smaller and labeled with a downward force \"f\", the right piston is larger and labeled with an upward force \"F\".\n  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.\n  • The vertical distance between the pistons is marked as \"h = 8 cm\".\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • The pistons are shown as solid disks fitting snugly in the arms of the vessel.\n  • The force \"f\" is applied downward on the smaller piston, while the force \"F\" is exerted upward on the larger piston.\n  • The height difference between the pistons is explicitly labeled as 8 cm.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The smaller piston (left) is at a higher position than the larger piston (right).\n  • The forces are applied in opposite directions: \"f\" downward, \"F\" upward.\n  • The liquid transmits pressure from one piston to the other through the U-shaped connection.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The figure visually demonstrates Pascal's principle: a force applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.\n  • The difference in piston areas and the labeled height suggest a setup for analyzing mechanical advantage or pressure transmission in hydraulic systems.\n  • The labeled height (8 cm) may be relevant for calculating pressure differences or force ratios. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.072,t=0.289,r=0.290,b=0.450), with ID 785b55be-b6d9-49b0-9a11-bdee6864f9ff -->\n\nاختر: الشكل المقابل يوضح مكبس

liquid.\n  • A piston (مكبس) is fitted at the top, pressing down on the liquid.\n  • The piston is labeled with the external pressure Pa (ضغط خارجي).\n  • The liquid column beneath the piston is labeled with height h (ارتفاع السائل).\n  • The pressure at a point A at the bottom of the liquid is labeled P(مكبس).\n  • The container is labeled as \"إناء زجاجي\" (glass vessel), and the liquid is labeled \"سائل\" (liquid).\n  • The illustration uses arrows to indicate the direction of pressure applied by the piston.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No scale bar or magnification is present.\n  • All labels are in Arabic.\n  • The diagram is schematic, not to scale.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The piston is at the top, in direct contact with the liquid surface.\n  • The height h is measured

the principle of hydraulic systems, showing how a force applied to a larger piston (A) is transmitted through an incompressible fluid to a smaller piston (a), resulting in a different force output.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • Two vertical cylinders of different diameters are connected at the base by a U-shaped tube filled with liquid.\n  • The left cylinder (larger) is labeled \"A\" with a piston on top, and a downward force \"F\" is applied.\n  • The right cylinder (smaller) is labeled \"a\" with a piston on top, and a downward force \"f\" is applied.\n  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.\n  • The diagram is labeled \"شكل ۲\" (Figure 2 in Persian) at the bottom.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No scale bar or units are provided.\n  • The pistons are shown as flat disks fitting tightly in their respective cylinders.\n  • The forces \"F\" and \"f\" are indicated by downward arrows.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The larger piston (A) is on the left, the smaller piston (a) is on the right.\n  • The liquid connects both pistons, allowing force transmission.\n  • The dashed line indicates equal liquid levels, signifying pressure balance.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The figure visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.\n  • The difference in piston areas (A > a) means the forces (F and f) are related by the ratio of their areas, illustrating mechanical advantage in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0

difference on pressure transmission and the resulting equations.\n\nillustration:\n# Left Panel: Pistons at Different Levels (Piston 2 Higher)\n  • Shows a U-shaped tube with two pistons: piston 1 (area a, force f) at a lower level, piston 2 (area A, force F) at a higher level (height difference h).\n  • The pressure at both pistons is set equal: P₁ = P₂.\n  • The pressure equation is: f/a = F/A + ρgh, where ρ is fluid density and g is gravitational acceleration.\n\n# Middle Panel: Pistons at Different Levels (Piston 1 Higher)\n  • Similar U-tube, but piston 1 is now at a higher level than piston 2 (height difference h).\n  • The pressure at both pistons is set equal: P₁ = P₂.\n  • The pressure equation is: f/a + ρgh = F/A.\n\n# Right Panel: Pistons at the Same Level\n  • U-shaped tube with both pistons at the same horizontal level.\n  • The pressure at both pistons is set equal: P₁ = P₂.\n  • The pressure equation is: f/a = F/A.\n\n# Headings and Labels:\n  • Top left and middle: \"المكبسـان في مستويين مختلفين\" (\"The pistons at different levels\").\n  • Top right: \"المكبسـان في نفس المستـوى الأفقي\" (\"The pistons at the same horizontal level\").\n  • Each panel includes labeled forces (f, F), areas (a, A), and height difference (h).\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at different heights, the pressure transmission between them is affected by the hydrostatic pressure term (ρgh), which must be added or subtracted depending on which piston is higher.\n  • When pistons are at the same level, the pressure relationship simplifies to a direct ratio of forces to areas (f/a = F/A), illustrating Pascal's principle in its simplest form.\n  • The equations visually reinforce the importance of height differences in hydraulic systems.

-->\n\nSummary : This illustration shows a U-shaped container filled with fluid, with two pistons of different areas placed on each side. The left piston is smaller and labeled with a downward force \"f\", while the right piston is larger and labeled with an upward force \"F\". The height difference between the fluid levels under the pistons is marked as h = 8 cm.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • The main subject is a U-shaped vessel containing a fluid.\n  • Two pistons are inserted into the open ends of the vessel: a smaller piston on the left and a larger piston on the right.\n  • The left piston is acted upon by a downward force labeled \"f\".\n  • The right piston is acted upon by an upward force labeled \"F\".\n  • The fluid level under the right piston is higher than under the left piston.\n  • The vertical distance between the two fluid surfaces is labeled as h = 8 cm.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • The height difference between the fluid surfaces is explicitly marked as 8 cm.\n  • Both pistons are shown as flat, circular, and fit tightly in the vessel.\n  • No scale bar or magnification is provided.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The left piston is positioned lower than the right piston due to the height difference in fluid levels.\n  • The forces \"f\" and \"F\" are shown as arrows, with \"f\" pointing downward and \"F\" pointing upward.\n  • The vessel is symmetric, and the pistons are aligned vertically above each arm of the U-tube.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration visually represents Pascal's principle, where a force applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.\n  • The height difference (h = 8 cm) suggests a pressure difference between the two sides, likely related to the forces applied to the pistons and their respective areas.\n  • The setup is commonly used to demonstrate hydraulic systems and mechanical advantage. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.596,r=0.302,b=0.754), with ID 5c9cd350-63e1-4746-a507-7552e114fec7 -->\n\n(1) القوة المؤثرة على المكبس الكبير تساوي ............\n\n6.5 × 10³ N  أ\n\n1.5 × 10³ N  ب\n\n1.8 × 10³ N  ج\n\n1.9 × 10³ N  د <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.368,t=0.728,r=0.909,b=0.824), with ID 4b1de87e-68dd-497e-9031-b4fd156615fd -->\n\n(٢) الفائدة الآلية للمكبس الهيدروليكي تساوي ............ <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.471,t=0.834,r=0.910,b=0.860), with ID 2b1cc2bc-080e-4974-a590-156ac6ff428d -->\n\n20 ⏷    15 ⟶    10 ☺    5 ⓘ <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.282,t=0.866,r=0.882,b=0.895), with ID 487f11c1-4e1c-4218-93ab-ed65cf6e7e05 -->\n\n$1 \\cdot 8$ <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.873,t=0.936,r=0.926,b=0.962), with ID dcac6b5d-b2cd-4f30-bd20-ccaadd87f2ac -->",
