containing a liquid labeled in Arabic as \"السائل الهيدروليكي\" (hydraulic fluid).\n  • The liquid level is higher under the smaller piston and lower under the larger piston, indicating pressure transmission.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No scale bar or measurement units are present.\n  • The pistons are colored brown, and the hydraulic fluid is light blue.\n  • Arabic text is used for labeling: \"A\" (left piston), \"a\" (right piston), and \"السائل الهيدروليكي\" (hydraulic fluid).\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The larger piston (A) is on the left, the smaller piston (a) is on the right.\n  • The U-shaped tube connects both pistons, allowing the hydraulic fluid to transmit force between them.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration demonstrates the principle of hydraulic systems, where force applied to the larger piston (A) is transmitted through the hydraulic fluid to the smaller piston (a), exemplifying Pascal's law.\n  • The difference in piston sizes suggests a mechanical advantage, with the system likely used to amplify force. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.075,t=0.659,r=0.344,b=0.773), with ID 24a1eefc-0979-4d14-899c-c4cc70556eca -->\n\nالحصول على قوة كبيرة

with area labeled \"A\" and force \"F\" applied upward.\n  • The right cylinder contains a smaller piston with area \"a\" and force \"f\" applied downward.\n  • Both pistons are shown pressing on the fluid, with the fluid level continuous between the two sides.\n\n# Labels & Annotations :\n  • The left piston is labeled with \"A\" (area) and \"F\" (force).\n  • The right piston is labeled with \"a\" (area) and \"f\" (force).\n  • Vertical distances from the fluid surface to the pistons are marked as \"y₂\" (left) and \"y₁\" (right).\n  • The fluid is labeled as \"السانل الهيدروليكي\"

right piston is smaller and sits lower, with the fluid level equalized between the two sides.\n  • The forces are shown acting in opposite directions: F upward on the left, f downward on the

force on a small piston to balance a larger force on a larger piston, depending on the ratio of their areas.\n  • The labeled distances (y₁, y₂) and areas (A, a) suggest the system is used to analyze

setup demonstrates how a small force on a small piston can balance a larger force on a larger piston if the ratio of forces equals the ratio of areas (F/A = f/a).\n  • This is the foundational concept behind hydraulic lifts and presses. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.472,r=0.278,b=0.611), with ID 802eca5a-abcd-44e0-bb88-9178fcc019ae -->\n\n- لكي يعود المكبسان في مستوي أفقي واحد كما في الشكل

two pistons, comparing cases where the pistons are at different levels versus the same horizontal level, and provides the corresponding pressure equations.\n\ndiagram:\n# Pistons at Different Levels :\n  • Two sub-diagrams on the left show pistons labeled \"1\" (area a, force f) and \"2\" (area A, force F) in U-shaped tubes with liquid.\n  • In both, piston 2 is higher than piston 1 by a height h.\n  • The pressure at the bottom of both sides is set equal: P₁ = P₂.\n  • The pressure equation is: f/a = F/A + ρgh, where ρ is the liquid density and h is the height difference.\n\n# Pistons at the Same Horizontal Level :\n  • The rightmost diagram shows pistons 1 and 2 at the same liquid level.\n  • The pressure at the bottom of both sides is equal: P₁ = P₂.\n  • The pressure equation simplifies to: f/a = F/A.\n\n# Equations and Annotations :\n  • All diagrams show the relationship between applied force, piston area, and pressure.\n  • The effect of height difference (h) is included only when pistons are at different levels.\n  • Arabic text labels the cases: \"المكبسـان في مستويين مختلفين\" (pistons at different levels) and \"المكبسـان في نفس المستوى الأفقي\" (pistons at the same horizontal level).\n\n# Analysis :\n  • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference includes a hydrostatic term (ρgh).\n  • When pistons are at the same level, the pressure relationship depends only on the ratio of forces to areas.\n  • The diagrams visually reinforce the effect of height on pressure transmission in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0

force f applied to piston 1 (area a), large force F applied to piston 2 (area A).\n  • Height difference h (opposite direction).\n  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n  • Equation: f/a + ρgh = F/A.\n\n# Right Diagram – \"المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي\" (Pistons at the same horizontal level) :\n  • Both pistons at the same height.\n  • Forces: Small force f on piston 1 (area a), large force F on piston 2 (area A).\n  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n  • Equation: f/a = F/A.\n\n# Technical Details :\n  • All diagrams use the same symbols: f (small force), F (large force), a (small area), A (large area), h (height difference), ρ (density), g (gravity).\n  • Each diagram includes a schematic of the fluid and pistons, with arrows indicating force direction.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure demonstrates how the pressure balance and force-area relationship in a hydraulic system depend on the relative heights of the pistons.\n  • When pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal on both sides.\n  • When pistons are at different levels, the hydrostatic pressure term (ρgh) must be included, either added or subtracted depending on which piston is higher.\n  • The equations visually reinforce Pascal’s principle and the effect of height differences in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID
