large piston (A) is transmitted through an incompressible fluid to a smaller piston (a), resulting in a different force output.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • Two vertical cylinders are connected at the base by a horizontal tube, forming a U-shaped vessel filled with liquid.\n  • The left cylinder contains a large piston labeled \"A\" with a downward force \"F\" applied.\n  • The right cylinder contains a smaller piston labeled \"a\" with a downward force \"f\" applied.\n  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.\n  • The diagram is labeled \"شكل ۲\" (Figure 2) in Persian.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No scale bar or units are provided.\n  • The pistons are circular and fit tightly in their respective cylinders.\n  • The forces \"F\" and \"f\" are shown as vertical arrows pointing downward.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The left piston (A) is larger in diameter than the right piston (a).\n  • The connecting tube allows pressure to be transmitted between the two sides.\n  • The pistons are positioned at the same vertical height, indicating equal fluid pressure at that level.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The figure visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.\n  • The difference in piston areas (A > a) suggests that a small force on the small piston can balance a larger force on the large piston, or vice versa, depending on the area ratio.\n  • The system is in static equilibrium, as indicated by the equal fluid levels. <!-- figure, from page 0

the relationship between force, area, and pressure when the pistons are at the same or different levels, with corresponding equations.\n\ndiagram:\n# Title :\n  • Title in Arabic: \"حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار\" (Hydraulic piston states at equilibrium).\n\n# Layout :\n  • Three side-by-side schematic diagrams, each showing a U-shaped hydraulic system with two pistons (labeled 1 and 2).\n  • Each diagram is labeled with a descriptive heading in Arabic.\n\n# Left Diagram – \"المكبان في مستويين مختلفين\" (Pistons at different levels) :\n  • Shows piston 1 (left) at a higher level than piston 2 (right).\n  • Forces: Small force f applied to piston 1 (area a), large force F applied to piston 2 (area A).\n  • Height difference h between pistons.\n  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n  • Equation: f/a = F/A + ρgh.\n\n# Middle Diagram – \"المكبان في مستويين مختلفين\" (Pistons at different levels) :\n  • Shows piston 1 (left) at a lower level than piston 2 (right).\n  • Forces: Small force f applied to piston 1 (area a), large force F applied to piston 2 (area A).\n  • Height difference h (opposite direction).\n  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n  • Equation: f/a + ρgh = F/A.\n\n# Right Diagram – \"المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي\" (Pistons at the same horizontal level) :\n  • Both pistons at the same height.\n  • Forces: Small force f on piston 1 (area a), large force F on piston 2 (area A).\n  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n  • Equation: f/a = F/A.\n\n# Technical Details :\n  • All diagrams use the same symbols: f (small force), F (large force), a (small area), A (large area), h (height difference), ρ (density), g (gravity).\n  • Each diagram includes a schematic of the fluid and pistons, with arrows indicating force direction.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure demonstrates how the pressure balance and force-area relationship in a hydraulic system depend on the relative heights of the pistons.\n  • When pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal on both sides.\n  • When pistons are at different levels, the hydrostatic pressure term (ρgh) must be included, either added or subtracted depending on which piston is higher.\n  • The equations visually reinforce Pascal’s principle and the effect of height differences in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID
