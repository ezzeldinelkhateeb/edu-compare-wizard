Summary : This is a labeled schematic diagram illustrating the operation of a hydraulic fluid system, showing how force and area relate in two connected pistons of different sizes.

illustration:
# System Overview :
  • The diagram shows two vertical cylinders connected at the base, both filled with a hydraulic fluid.
  • The left cylinder contains a large piston with area labeled "A" and force "F" applied upward.
  • The right cylinder contains a smaller piston with area "a" and force "f" applied downward.
  • Both pistons are shown pressing on the fluid, with the fluid level continuous between the two sides.

# Labels & Annotations :
  • The left piston is labeled with "A" (area) and "F" (force).
  • The right piston is labeled with "a" (area) and "f" (force).
  • Vertical distances from the fluid surface to the pistons are marked as "y₂" (left) and "y₁" (right).
  • The fluid is labeled as "السانل الهيدروليكي" (hydraulic fluid).
  • The diagram is referenced as "شكل (1)" (Figure 1).

# Spatial Relationships :
  • The left piston is larger and sits higher above the fluid than the right piston.
  • The right piston is smaller and sits lower, with the fluid level equalized between the two sides.
  • The forces are shown acting in opposite directions: F upward on the left, f downward on the right.

# Analysis :
  • The diagram visually demonstrates Pascal's principle in hydraulic systems, where a force applied to a fluid in a closed system is transmitted undiminished, allowing a small force on a small piston to balance a larger force on a larger piston, depending on the ratio of their areas.
  • The labeled distances (y₁, y₂) and areas (A, a) suggest the system is used to analyze pressure, force, and displacement relationships in hydraulics. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.064,t=0.061,r=0.415,b=0.252), with ID 016d6ffa-5ebf-4460-a8f3-8304add4958e -->

Summary : This illustration demonstrates the principle of hydraulic systems, showing how a force applied to a larger piston is transmitted through an incompressible fluid to a smaller piston, resulting in a different force output.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The image shows a U-shaped container filled with liquid, with two vertical cylinders of different diameters attached to each end.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled "A" (area) with a piston on top, and a downward force "F" applied.
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled "a" (area) with a piston on top, and a downward force "f" applied.
  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.
  • The diagram is labeled in Persian as "شکل ۲" (Figure 2).

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or units are provided.
  • Forces are indicated by arrows and labeled "F" (left, large piston) and "f" (right, small piston).
  • Piston areas are labeled "A" (left) and "a" (right).

Spatial Relationships :
  • The larger piston (left) and smaller piston (right) are connected by the same fluid, illustrating pressure transmission.
  • The pistons are at the same vertical height, showing equal fluid pressure at that level.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The setup demonstrates how a small force on a small piston can balance a larger force on a larger piston if the ratio of forces equals the ratio of areas (F/A = f/a).
  • This is the foundational concept behind hydraulic lifts and presses. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.472,r=0.278,b=0.611), with ID 802eca5a-abcd-44e0-bb88-9178fcc019ae -->

Summary : This figure illustrates the pressure relationships in a hydraulic system with two pistons, comparing cases where the pistons are at different levels versus the same horizontal level, and provides the corresponding pressure equations.

diagram:
# Pistons at Different Levels :
  • Two sub-diagrams on the left show pistons labeled "1" (area a, force f) and "2" (area A, force F) in U-shaped tubes with liquid.
  • In both, piston 2 is higher than piston 1 by a height h.
  • The pressure at the bottom of both sides is set equal: P₁ = P₂.
  • The pressure equation is: f/a = F/A + ρgh, where ρ is the liquid density and h is the height difference.

# Pistons at the Same Horizontal Level :
  • The rightmost diagram shows pistons 1 and 2 at the same liquid level.
  • The pressure at the bottom of both sides is equal: P₁ = P₂.
  • The pressure equation simplifies to: f/a = F/A.

# Equations and Annotations :
  • All diagrams show the relationship between applied force, piston area, and pressure.
  • The effect of height difference (h) is included only when pistons are at different levels.
  • Arabic text labels the cases: "المكبسـان في مستويين مختلفين" (pistons at different levels) and "المكبسـان في نفس المستوى الأفقي" (pistons at the same horizontal level).

# Analysis :
  • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference includes a hydrostatic term (ρgh).
  • When pistons are at the same level, the pressure relationship depends only on the ratio of forces to areas.
  • The diagrams visually reinforce the effect of height on pressure transmission in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.651,r=0.888,b=0.892), with ID 8f7e6952-e3fd-45e2-9c20-cfe64592c10f -->
