Summary : This is a labeled diagram and accompanying explanation illustrating the operation of a hydraulic press, showing how force and pressure are transmitted through a hydraulic fluid between two pistons of different areas.

illustration:
# Diagram Overview :
  • The diagram shows two connected cylinders (left: large, right: small) filled with hydraulic fluid (labeled "السائل الهيدروليكي").
  • The left cylinder has a large piston with area "A" and force "F" applied upward.
  • The right cylinder has a small piston with area "a" and force "f" applied downward.
  • The heights of the fluid under each piston are labeled "y1" (left) and "y2" (right).
  • The pistons are at the same horizontal level.

# Arabic Text Explanation :
  • When the pistons are at the same horizontal level and a force "f" is applied to the small piston, a pressure "P" is produced at the bottom of the small piston: P = f / a.
  • This pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid and to the bottom of the large piston.
  • The large piston experiences an upward force "F" given by F = P × A, or P = F / A.

# Equations Shown :
  • P = f / a
  • P = F / A

# Labels and Annotations :
  • "شكل (1)" (Figure 1) under the diagram.
  • "السائل الهيدروليكي" (hydraulic fluid) label inside the fluid.
  • Arrows indicating direction of forces (upward for F, downward for f).

Analysis :
  • The diagram and text together demonstrate Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The system allows a small force applied to a small piston to generate a larger force on a larger piston, proportional to the ratio of their areas.
  • The illustration is a classic example of hydraulic multiplication used in hydraulic presses and lifts. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID e78988d1-f8fb-4cb6-8bab-61269ef8a71e -->

Summary : This illustration shows a hydraulic system with two connected cylinders of different cross-sectional areas, each fitted with a piston and subjected to different forces.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The system consists of two vertical cylinders connected at the base, forming a U-shape filled with liquid.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with piston area "A" and force "F" applied downward.
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area "a" and force "f" applied downward.
  • Both pistons are shown pressing down on the liquid, with the liquid level equal in both arms.
  • The diagram is labeled "شكل ۲" (Figure 2 in Persian/Arabic numerals).

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or units are provided.
  • The pistons are depicted as flat, circular disks.
  • The liquid is shown as a uniform blue fill, indicating incompressibility and equal height.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The larger piston (A) is on the left, the smaller piston (a) is on the right.
  • The forces (F and f) are applied vertically downward on each piston.
  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually demonstrates Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The system suggests that a small force on the small piston (f) can balance a larger force on the large piston (F) if the area ratio is appropriate, illustrating the mechanical advantage of hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.061,t=0.476,r=0.270,b=0.615), with ID d9fdd71d-a3f4-4ecd-b330-82f8d55678db -->

# Title & Layout :
  • Title (top right): "حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار" ("Hydraulic piston states at equilibrium").
  • Three side-by-side panels, each showing a U-shaped hydraulic system with two pistons (labeled 1 and 2), with forces and areas indicated.
  • Left and center panels: pistons at different heights. Right panel: pistons at the same height.

# Left Panel – "المكبان في مستويين مختلفين" ("Pistons at different levels") :
  • Shows two pistons (1 and 2) at different vertical positions in a U-tube filled with fluid.
  • Piston 1 (left) at height h above piston 2 (right).
  • Forces: f applied on piston 1 (area a), F on piston 2 (area A).
  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a = F/A + ρgh.

# Center Panel – "المكبان في مستويين مختلفين" ("Pistons at different levels") :
  • Similar to left panel, but piston 2 is now higher than piston 1.
  • Forces: f on piston 1 (area a), F on piston 2 (area A).
  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a + ρgh = F/A.

# Right Panel – "المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي" ("Pistons at the same horizontal level") :
  • Both pistons at the same height in the U-tube.
  • Forces: f on piston 1 (area a), F on piston 2 (area A).
  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a = F/A.

# Design Encodings :
  • Schematic diagrams with labeled pistons, forces, and heights.
  • Arrows indicate direction of applied forces.
  • Equations shown below each diagram.
  • Fluid level and height difference (h) clearly marked.

# Analysis :
  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same height, the pressure ratio equals the force-to-area ratio (f/a = F/A).
  • When pistons are at different heights, the hydrostatic pressure difference (ρgh) must be included in the pressure balance.
  • The diagrams and equations together clarify how force transmission in hydraulic systems depends on piston area and height difference. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID d9fe835b-5d52-40a8-852f-dd2169c37284 -->
