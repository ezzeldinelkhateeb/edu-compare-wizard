Levels, Case 1) :\n  • Shows a U-tube with piston 1 (area a, force f) at a lower level than piston 2 (area A, force F).\n  • Fluid height difference h is marked.\n  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n  •

forces to areas.\n  • The diagrams visually reinforce the effect of height difference on pressure transmission in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.651,r=0.888,b=0.892), with ID
