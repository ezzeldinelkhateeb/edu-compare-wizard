Summary : This is a labeled schematic illustration of a hydraulic fluid system, showing two pistons of different areas connected by a U-shaped tube filled with liquid, used to demonstrate Pascal's principle.

illustration:
System Overview :
  • Two vertical cylinders connected by a U-shaped tube, both filled with a liquid labeled "السانل الهيدروليكي" (hydraulic fluid).
  • Left cylinder: Large piston with area labeled "A" and upward force "F".
  • Right cylinder: Small piston with area labeled "a" and downward force "f".
  • Both pistons are shown pressing on the fluid at different heights.

Labels & Dimensions :
  • Vertical distances from the fluid surface to the pistons are marked as "y2" (left) and "y1" (right).
  • Forces: "F" (upward, left piston), "f" (downward, right piston).
  • Areas: "A" (left piston), "a" (right piston).
  • The figure is labeled "شكل (1)" (Figure 1).

Technical Details :
  • The illustration is colored, with the fluid shown in blue.
  • The system is used to demonstrate the transmission of pressure in a hydraulic system.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The left piston is larger and higher than the right piston.
  • The U-tube connects the two cylinders at the base, allowing fluid communication.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually demonstrates how a force applied to a small-area piston (right) can be transmitted through a fluid to produce a larger force on a larger-area piston (left), illustrating the principle of hydraulic multiplication (Pascal's law).
  • The labeled heights (y1, y2) suggest the importance of pressure differences due to depth in the fluid. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.064,t=0.061,r=0.415,b=0.252), with ID 2223867b-3101-4b6d-b143-1ab29c5ad105 -->

Summary : This illustration demonstrates the principle of hydraulic systems, showing how a force applied to a larger piston is transmitted through an incompressible fluid to a smaller piston, resulting in a different force output.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The image shows a U-shaped container filled with liquid, with two vertical cylinders of different diameters attached to each end.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled "A" (area) with a piston on top, and a downward force "F" applied.
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled "a" (area) with a piston on top, and a downward force "f" applied.
  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.
  • The diagram is labeled in Persian as "شکل ۲" (Figure 2).

Technical Details :
  • The pistons are circular and fit tightly in their respective cylinders.
  • The forces "F" and "f" are shown as arrows pointing downward on the pistons.
  • The areas of the pistons are denoted as "A" (large) and "a" (small).
  • The liquid is colored blue for clarity.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The larger piston/cylinder is on the left, the smaller on the right.
  • The pistons are at the same vertical height, indicating equal pressure transmission.
  • The U-shaped tube connects the two cylinders at the bottom, allowing fluid communication.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The system demonstrates how a small force applied to a small area can balance a larger force applied to a larger area, or vice versa, depending on the area ratio.
  • The equal liquid levels confirm that the pressures at the pistons are equal (F/A = f/a) when in equilibrium. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.472,r=0.278,b=0.611), with ID 23946afc-38e9-4dc7-8bbf-6f55ff00b0cc -->

Summary : This figure compares the pressure relationships and equations for two pistons in a U-tube hydraulic system, considering cases where the pistons are at different and the same horizontal levels.

illustration:
# Left Panel: Pistons at Different Levels (Pistons in Different Levels)
  • Shows a U-tube with two pistons: piston 1 (area a, force f) at a lower level than piston 2 (area A, force F).
  • The height difference between the pistons is labeled h.
  • The pressure equality is given as P₁ = P₂.
  • The pressure equation is: f/a = F/A + ρgh.

# Middle Panel: Pistons at Different Levels (Alternate Configuration)
  • Similar U-tube with pistons at different heights, but the left piston is now higher than the right.
  • The same variables are used: piston 1 (area a, force f), piston 2 (area A, force F), height difference h.
  • The pressure equality is P₁ = P₂.
  • The pressure equation is: f/a + ρgh = F/A.

# Right Panel: Pistons at the Same Level (Pistons in the Same Horizontal Level)
  • U-tube with both pistons at the same horizontal level.
  • Piston 1 (area a, force f) and piston 2 (area A, force F) are at equal heights.
  • The pressure equality is P₁ = P₂.
  • The pressure equation is: f/a = F/A.

# Analysis :
  • The figure demonstrates how the pressure relationship between two pistons in a hydraulic system changes depending on their relative heights.
  • When pistons are at different levels, the hydrostatic pressure term (ρgh) must be included, either added or subtracted depending on which piston is higher.
  • When pistons are at the same level, the pressure relationship simplifies to a direct ratio of forces to areas.
  • The diagrams visually reinforce the equations and the effect of height difference on hydraulic pressure transmission. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.651,r=0.888,b=0.892), with ID 16884e5e-5c64-4139-b071-f3b56b361354 -->
