Summary : This is a labeled illustration and accompanying explanation of the operation of a hydraulic press, showing how force and pressure are transmitted through a hydraulic fluid between two pistons of different areas.

illustration:
# Diagram Overview :
  • The diagram shows two connected cylinders (left: large, right: small) filled with hydraulic fluid (labeled "السائل الهيدروليكي").
  • The left cylinder has a large piston with area "A" and force "F" applied downward.
  • The right cylinder has a small piston with area "a" and force "f" applied downward.
  • Both pistons are at the same horizontal level, with vertical distances y₁ and y₂ marked.
  • The system is labeled as "شكل (1)".

# Annotations & Labels :
  • Left piston: "A" (area), "F" (force), "y₁" (vertical position).
  • Right piston: "a" (area), "f" (force), "y₂" (vertical position).
  • Connecting tube links the two cylinders at the base.
  • Fluid is labeled as "السائل الهيدروليكي".

# Accompanying Text (Key Points) :
  • When both pistons are at the same horizontal level, applying force "f" to the small piston creates a pressure P at its base: P = f / a.
  • This pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid to the base of the large piston.
  • The large piston experiences an upward force F, given by F = P × A, or P = F / A.
  • The explanation references Pascal's principle and the transmission of pressure in fluids.

# Analysis :
  • The illustration demonstrates Pascal's law: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The system amplifies force: a small force on the small piston (with small area) can generate a much larger force on the large piston (with large area), as shown by the equations.
  • The diagram and text together clarify the mechanical advantage of hydraulic presses. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID e06a56f9-317c-44c9-a84d-520ff4f7dbb4 -->

Summary : This illustration demonstrates a hydraulic system with two connected cylinders of different cross-sectional areas, each fitted with a piston and subjected to different applied forces.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The system consists of two vertical cylinders connected at the base, forming a U-shape filled with liquid.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with piston area "A" and applied force "F" directed downward.
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area "a" and applied force "f" also directed downward.
  • Both pistons are shown at the same liquid level, indicating equilibrium.
  • The diagram is labeled "شكل ۲" (Figure 2 in Persian).

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or explicit units are provided.
  • The pistons are depicted as flat, circular disks.
  • The liquid is shown as a uniform blue fill, with the surface at the same height in both cylinders.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The larger cylinder (left) and smaller cylinder (right) are connected at the base, allowing fluid communication.
  • The pistons are positioned at the top of the liquid columns, with arrows indicating the direction of applied forces.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually represents Pascal's principle, illustrating how a force applied to a larger piston (F on area A) can be balanced by a smaller force (f on area a) due to the difference in piston areas, as the pressure is transmitted equally through the fluid.
  • The equal liquid levels indicate the system is in static equilibrium. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.061,t=0.476,r=0.270,b=0.615), with ID 0c636a2e-d624-460d-a9d5-958fe7557a56 -->

Summary : This figure illustrates the different equilibrium states of a hydraulic piston system, showing the relationship between force, area, and fluid pressure when the pistons are at the same or different heights. It provides diagrams, equations, and explanations for each scenario.

diagram:  
# حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار (Hydraulic Piston States at Equilibrium) :

## المكبسان في نفس المستوى الأفقي (Pistons at the Same Horizontal Level) :
  • Diagram shows two pistons (1 and 2) at equal fluid heights.
  • Forces: Small piston (left) with force f and area a; large piston (right) with force F and area A.
  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, so f/a = F/A.

## المكبسان في مستويين مختلفين (Pistons at Different Levels) :
  • Two sub-cases shown:
    – Left: Small piston higher than large piston by height h.
    – Right: Large piston higher than small piston by height h.
  • Forces and areas as above.
  • Equations:
    – For left sub-case: f/a = F/A + ρgh
    – For right sub-case: f/a + ρgh = F/A
  • ρ is fluid density, g is gravitational acceleration, h is height difference.

## Visual Elements :
  • Each scenario is depicted with a U-shaped tube filled with fluid, pistons labeled 1 and 2, and arrows indicating applied forces.
  • Dashed lines indicate reference fluid levels.
  • All equations are written below each diagram.

# Analysis :
  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal on both sides.
  • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference due to the fluid column (ρgh) must be considered, altering the force balance.
  • The diagrams and equations together clarify how hydraulic equilibrium depends on both force/area and height differences in the fluid. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID 03031238-3a72-48fa-8518-e495eb2e6d90 -->
