between two pistons of different areas.\n\nillustration:\n# Diagram Overview :\n  • The diagram shows two connected cylinders (left: large, right: small) filled with hydraulic fluid (labeled \"السائل الهيدروليكي\").\n  • The left cylinder has a large piston with area \"A\" and force \"F\" applied downward.\n  • The right cylinder has a small piston with area \"a\" and force \"f\" applied downward.\n  • Both pistons are at the same horizontal level, with vertical distances y₁ and y₂ marked.\n  • The system is labeled as \"شكل (1)\".\n\n# Annotations & Labels :\n  • Left piston: \"A\" (area), \"F\" (force), \"y₁\" (vertical position).\n  • Right piston: \"a\" (area), \"f\" (force), \"y₂\" (vertical position).\n  • Connecting tube links the two cylinders at the base.\n  • Fluid is labeled as \"السائل الهيدروليكي\".\n\n# Accompanying Text (Key Points) :\n  • When both pistons are at the same horizontal level, applying force \"f\" to the small piston creates a pressure P at its base: P = f / a.\n  • This pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid to the base of the large piston.\n  • The large piston experiences an upward force F, given by F = P × A, or P = F / A.\n  • The explanation references Pascal's principle and the transmission of pressure in fluids.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The illustration demonstrates Pascal's law: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.\n  • The system amplifies force: a small force on the small piston (with small area) can generate a much larger force on the large piston (with large area), as shown by the equations.\n  • The diagram and text together clarify the mechanical advantage of hydraulic presses. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID

      "text": "Summary : This figure illustrates the different equilibrium states of a hydraulic piston system, showing the relationship between force, area, and fluid pressure when the pistons are at the same or different heights. It provides diagrams, equations, and explanations for each scenario.\n\ndiagram:  \n# حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار (Hydraulic Piston States at Equilibrium) :\n\n## المكبسان في نفس المستوى الأفقي (Pistons at the Same Horizontal Level) :\n  • Diagram shows two pistons (1 and 2) at equal fluid heights.\n  • Forces: Small piston (left) with force f and area a; large piston (right) with force F and area A.\n  • Equation: P₁ = P₂, so f/a = F/A.\n\n## المكبسان في مستويين مختلفين (Pistons at Different Levels) :\n  • Two sub-cases shown:\n    – Left: Small piston higher than large piston by height h.\n    – Right: Large piston higher than small piston by height h.\n  • Forces and areas as above.\n  • Equations:\n    – For left sub-case: f/a = F/A + ρgh\n    – For right sub-case: f/a + ρgh = F/A\n  • ρ is fluid density, g is gravitational acceleration, h is height difference.\n\n## Visual Elements :\n  • Each scenario is depicted with a U-shaped tube filled with fluid, pistons labeled 1 and 2, and arrows indicating applied forces.\n  • Dashed lines indicate reference fluid levels.\n  • All equations are written below each diagram.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal on both sides.\n  • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference due to the fluid column (ρgh) must be considered, altering the force balance.\n  • The diagrams and equations together clarify how hydraulic equilibrium depends on both force/area and height differences in the fluid.",
