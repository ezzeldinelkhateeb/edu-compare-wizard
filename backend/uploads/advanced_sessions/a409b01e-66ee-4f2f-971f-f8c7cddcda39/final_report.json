transmitted through a hydraulic fluid to a larger piston, resulting in a larger force.\n\nillustration:\n# Hydraulic System Diagram :\n  • Two vertical cylinders (left: large, right: small) connected at the base by a horizontal tube, all filled with hydraulic fluid (labeled \"السائل الهيدروليكي\").\n  • Left cylinder: large piston with area \"A\" and upward force \"F\" applied; vertical distance

pistons are at the same horizontal level.\n\n# Mathematical Relationships :\n  • Pressure under the small piston: P = f / a\n  • Pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid.\n  • Force on the

(a) is on the right.\n  • Both pistons are at the same vertical height, with the liquid surface continuous between them.\n  • The connecting tube is at the bottom, ensuring the liquid can transmit pressure between the two sides.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.\n  • The difference in piston areas (A > a) suggests that a small force on the small piston can balance a larger force on the large piston, or vice versa, depending on the area ratio.\n  • The system is in static equilibrium, as indicated by the equal liquid levels. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.061,t=0.476,r=0.270,b=0.615), with ID 00a3331c-1e03-4e83-aa1a-a52f35eaf5ce -->\n\n- لكي يعود الكبسان في مستوى

the pistons.\n  • When pistons are at different heights, the hydrostatic pressure term (ρgh) must be included in the force-area relationship.\n  • When pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal for both pistons, illustrating Pascal's principle in its simplest form. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID a550734b-8514-4203-a266-d9d9234044be

showing a U-shaped tube filled with liquid and two pistons (labeled 1 and 2) with different surface areas (a and A).\n  • The left and center panels show pistons at different vertical levels, while the right panel shows pistons at the same horizontal level.\n\n## Left Panel (Pistons at Different Levels, Piston 2 Higher) :  \n  • Piston 1 (area a) is lower than piston 2 (area A).\n  • Force f is applied to piston 1, and force F is applied to piston 2.\n  • The height difference between pistons is h.\n  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n  • Formula: f/a = F/A + ρgh.\n\n## Center Panel (Pistons at Different Levels, Piston 2 Lower) :  \n  • Piston 1 (area a) is higher than piston 2 (area A).\n  • Force f is applied to piston 1, and force F is applied to piston 2.\n  • The height difference between pistons is h.\n  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n  • Formula: f/a + ρgh = F/A.\n\n## Right Panel (Pistons at Same Level) :  \n  • Both pistons are at the same horizontal level.\n  • Force f is applied to piston 1, and force F is applied to piston 2.\n  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n  • Formula: f/a = F/A.\n\n# Annotations & Text :  \n  • Arabic headings: \n    – \"المكبسـان في مستويين مختلفين\" (The pistons at different levels) for the left and center panels.\n    – \"المكبسـان في نفس المستوى الأفقي\" (The pistons at the same horizontal level) for the right panel.\n  • Each panel includes pressure equations and force-area relationships, with or without the hydrostatic term ρgh depending on the height difference.\n\n# Analysis :  \n  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at different heights, the pressure relationship includes a hydrostatic term (ρgh) due to the height difference.\n  • When pistons are at the same level, the pressure relationship simplifies to Pascal's law (f/a = F/A).\n  • The diagrams visually reinforce the effect of height on pressure transmission in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.651,r=0.888,b=0.892), with ID
