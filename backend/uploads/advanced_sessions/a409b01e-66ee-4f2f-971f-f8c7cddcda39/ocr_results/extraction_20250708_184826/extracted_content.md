Summary : This is a labeled illustration and accompanying explanation of a hydraulic system demonstrating Pascal's principle, showing how pressure applied to a small piston is transmitted through a hydraulic fluid to a larger piston, resulting in a larger force.

illustration:
# Hydraulic System Diagram :
  • Two vertical cylinders (left: large, right: small) connected at the base by a horizontal tube, all filled with hydraulic fluid (labeled "السائل الهيدروليكي").
  • Left cylinder: large piston with area "A" and upward force "F" applied; vertical distance "y1" marked from fluid surface to piston.
  • Right cylinder: small piston with area "a" and downward force "f" applied; vertical distance "y2" marked from fluid surface to piston.
  • Both pistons are at the same horizontal level.

# Mathematical Relationships :
  • Pressure under the small piston: P = f / a
  • Pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid.
  • Force on the large piston: F = P × A, so P = F / A

# Explanatory Text (Arabic) :
  • Describes that when both pistons are at the same horizontal level and a force "f" is applied to the small piston, a pressure "P" is generated beneath it.
  • This pressure is transmitted uniformly through the fluid to the large piston, resulting in an upward force "F".
  • The relationships P = f / a and P = F / A are given, illustrating Pascal's law.

# Analysis :
  • The diagram and equations illustrate Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished in all directions.
  • A small force applied to a small-area piston can generate a much larger force on a large-area piston, enabling force multiplication in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID 39c2ef68-aace-4baa-9ff3-011f346b326b -->

Summary : This illustration demonstrates the principle of hydraulic systems, showing how a force applied to a large piston is transmitted through a liquid to a smaller piston, resulting in a different force output.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The image shows two vertical cylinders of different diameters connected at the base by a U-shaped tube filled with liquid.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with piston area "A" and force "F" applied downward on the piston.
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area "a" and force "f" applied downward on the piston.
  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.
  • The diagram is labeled "شكل ۲" (Figure 2 in Persian).

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or units are provided.
  • The pistons are depicted as flat, circular disks fitting tightly in their respective cylinders.
  • The forces (F and f) are shown as vertical arrows pointing downward on each piston.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The larger piston (A) is on the left, the smaller piston (a) is on the right.
  • Both pistons are at the same vertical height, with the liquid surface continuous between them.
  • The connecting tube is at the bottom, ensuring the liquid can transmit pressure between the two sides.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The difference in piston areas (A > a) suggests that a small force on the small piston can balance a larger force on the large piston, or vice versa, depending on the area ratio.
  • The system is in static equilibrium, as indicated by the equal liquid levels. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.061,t=0.476,r=0.270,b=0.615), with ID 00a3331c-1e03-4e83-aa1a-a52f35eaf5ce -->

# Title & Layout :
  • Title (top right): "حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار" ("Hydraulic piston states at equilibrium").
  • Three side-by-side panels, each showing a U-shaped hydraulic system with two pistons (labeled 1 and 2) and annotated forces, areas, and heights.
  • Left and center panels: "المكبان في مستويين مختلفين" ("Pistons at different levels").
  • Right panel: "المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي" ("Pistons at the same horizontal level").

# Left Panel (Pistons at Different Levels, piston 1 higher) :
  • Piston 1 (left) at height h above piston 2 (right).
  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F to piston 2 (area A).
  • Fluid height difference h between pistons.
  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
  • Equation: f/a = F/A + ρgh.

# Center Panel (Pistons at Different Levels, piston 2 higher) :
  • Piston 2 (right) at height h above piston 1 (left).
  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F to piston 2 (area A).
  • Fluid height difference h between pistons.
  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
  • Equation: f/a + ρgh = F/A.

# Right Panel (Pistons at Same Level) :
  • Both pistons at the same horizontal level.
  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F to piston 2 (area A).
  • No height difference.
  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
  • Equation: f/a = F/A.

# Symbols & Annotations :
  • f: force on small piston (area a).
  • F: force on large piston (area A).
  • h: height difference between pistons.
  • ρ: fluid density.
  • g: gravitational acceleration.
  • P₁, P₂: pressures at pistons 1 and 2.

# Analysis :
  • The figure demonstrates how the pressure balance in a hydraulic system depends on the relative heights of the pistons.
  • When pistons are at different heights, the hydrostatic pressure term (ρgh) must be included in the force-area relationship.
  • When pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal for both pistons, illustrating Pascal's principle in its simplest form. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID a550734b-8514-4203-a266-d9d9234044be -->
