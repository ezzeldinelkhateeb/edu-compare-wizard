transmitted through a hydraulic fluid to a larger piston, resulting in a larger force.\n\nillustration:\n# Hydraulic System Diagram :\n  • Two vertical cylinders (left: large, right: small) connected at the base by a horizontal tube, all filled with hydraulic fluid (labeled \"السائل الهيدروليكي\").\n  • Left cylinder: large piston with area \"A\" and upward force \"F\" applied; vertical distance \"y1\" marked from fluid surface to piston.\n  • Right cylinder: small piston with area \"a\" and downward force \"f\" applied; vertical distance \"y2\" marked from fluid surface to piston.\n  • Both pistons are at the same horizontal level.\n\n# Mathematical Relationships :\n  • Pressure under the small piston: P = f / a\n  • Pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid.\n  • Force on the large piston: F = P × A, so P = F / A\n\n# Explanatory Text (Arabic) :\n  • Describes that when both pistons are at the same horizontal level and a force \"f\" is applied to the small piston, a pressure \"P\" is generated beneath it.\n  • This pressure is transmitted uniformly through the fluid to the large piston, resulting in an upward force \"F\".\n  • The relationships P = f / a and P = F / A are given, illustrating Pascal's law.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The diagram and equations illustrate Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished in all directions.\n  • A small force applied to a small-area piston can generate a much larger force on a large-area piston, enabling force multiplication in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0

force applied to a large piston is transmitted through a liquid to a smaller piston, resulting in a different force output.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • The image shows two vertical cylinders of different diameters connected at the base by a U-shaped tube filled with liquid.\n  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with piston area \"A\" and force \"F\" applied downward on the piston.\n  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area \"a\" and force \"f\" applied downward on the piston.\n  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.\n  • The diagram is labeled \"شكل ۲\" (Figure 2 in Persian).\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No scale bar or units are provided.\n  • The pistons are depicted as flat, circular disks fitting tightly in their respective cylinders.\n  • The forces (F and f) are shown as vertical arrows pointing downward on each piston.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The larger piston (A) is on the left, the smaller piston (a) is on the right.\n  • Both pistons are at the same vertical height, with the liquid surface continuous between them.\n  • The connecting tube is at the bottom, ensuring the liquid can transmit pressure between the two sides.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.\n  • The difference in piston areas (A > a) suggests that a small force on the small piston can balance a larger force on the large piston, or vice versa, depending on the area ratio.\n  • The system is in static equilibrium, as indicated by the equal liquid levels. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.061,t=0.476,r=0.270,b=0.615), with ID 00a3331c-1e03-4e83-aa1a-a52f35eaf5ce -->\n\n- لكي يعود الكبسان في مستوى

figure illustrates the different equilibrium states of a hydraulic piston system, showing the relationship between force, area, and pressure when the pistons are at the same or different levels, with corresponding equations.\n\ndiagram:\n# Title & Layout :\n  • Title (top right): \"حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار\" (\"Hydraulic piston states at equilibrium\").\n  • Three side-by-side panels, each showing a U-shaped hydraulic system with two pistons (labeled 1 and 2) and annotated forces, areas, and heights.\n  • Left and center panels: \"المكبان في مستويين مختلفين\" (\"Pistons at different levels\").\n  • Right panel: \"المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي\" (\"Pistons at the same horizontal level\").\n\n# Left Panel (Pistons at Different Levels, piston 1 higher) :\n  • Piston 1 (left) at height h above piston 2 (right).\n  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F to piston 2 (area A).\n  • Fluid height difference h between pistons.\n  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n  • Equation: f/a = F/A + ρgh.\n\n# Center Panel (Pistons at Different Levels, piston 2 higher) :\n  • Piston 2 (right) at height h above piston 1 (left).\n  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F to piston 2 (area A).\n  • Fluid height difference h between pistons.\n  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n  • Equation: f/a + ρgh = F/A.\n\n# Right Panel (Pistons at Same Level) :\n  • Both pistons at the same horizontal level.\n  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F to piston 2 (area A).\n  • No height difference.\n  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n  • Equation: f/a = F/A.\n\n# Symbols & Annotations :\n  • f: force on small piston (area a).\n  • F: force on large piston (area A).\n  • h: height difference between pistons.\n  • ρ: fluid density.\n  • g: gravitational acceleration.\n  • P₁, P₂: pressures at pistons 1 and 2.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure demonstrates how the pressure balance in a hydraulic system depends on the relative heights of the pistons.\n  • When pistons are at different heights, the hydrostatic pressure term (ρgh) must be included in the force-area relationship.\n  • When pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal for both pistons, illustrating Pascal's principle in its simplest form. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID a550734b-8514-4203-a266-d9d9234044be
