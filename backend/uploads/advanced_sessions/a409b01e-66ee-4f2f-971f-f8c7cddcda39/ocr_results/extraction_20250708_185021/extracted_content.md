Summary : This is a labeled illustration of a hydraulic fluid system, showing two connected cylinders of different cross-sectional areas, each with a piston, to demonstrate the principles of hydraulic force transmission.

illustration:
Hydraulic System Overview :
  • Two vertical cylinders are connected at the base and filled with a hydraulic fluid.
  • The left cylinder has a large piston (area labeled A) with an upward force F applied.
  • The right cylinder has a smaller piston (area labeled a) with a downward force f applied.
  • Both pistons are shown at different heights above a common fluid level.

Labels & Annotations :
  • The left piston is labeled with area "A" and force "F" (upward).
  • The right piston is labeled with area "a" and force "f" (downward).
  • Vertical distances from the fluid surface to the pistons are marked as y₂ (left) and y₁ (right).
  • The fluid is labeled as "السانل الهيدروليكي" (hydraulic fluid).
  • The diagram is referenced as "شكل (1)" (Figure 1).

Spatial Relationships :
  • The left piston is larger and higher above the fluid than the right piston.
  • The two cylinders are connected at the base, allowing fluid to transmit force between them.
  • The system is symmetric horizontally, with the fluid level continuous between the two sides.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually demonstrates Pascal’s principle: a force applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The difference in piston areas (A vs. a) and forces (F vs. f) suggests the system can multiply force, a key concept in hydraulic machines.
  • The labeled heights (y₁, y₂) indicate the importance of pressure differences at different depths. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.064,t=0.061,r=0.415,b=0.252), with ID 7b2055de-5dcd-495e-9f49-79f6eb6de48f -->

Summary : This illustration demonstrates the principle of hydraulic systems, showing how a force applied to a larger piston is transmitted through an incompressible fluid to a smaller piston, resulting in a different force output.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The image shows a U-shaped container filled with liquid, with two vertical cylinders of different diameters attached to each end.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled "A" (area) with a piston on top, and a downward force "F" applied.
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled "a" (area) with a piston on top, and a downward force "f" applied.
  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.
  • The diagram is labeled in Persian as "شکل ۲" (Figure 2).

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or units are provided.
  • The pistons are shown as solid disks fitting tightly in the cylinders.
  • The forces "F" and "f" are indicated by downward arrows.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The larger piston (A) is on the left, the smaller piston (a) is on the right.
  • The liquid connects both pistons, transmitting force between them.
  • The dashed line indicates equal liquid levels, signifying balanced pressure.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The system demonstrates how a small force on a small piston can balance a larger force on a larger piston if the ratio of forces equals the ratio of areas (F/A = f/a).
  • The image is likely used to teach the mechanical advantage in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.472,r=0.278,b=0.611), with ID d19705d7-80af-48cb-bd63-41ffc97932c0 -->

Summary : This figure compares the pressure relationships in hydraulic systems with pistons at different levels, illustrating how pressure is transmitted and calculated in each scenario using Pascal's principle.

diagram:  
# Pistons at Different Levels :  
  • The figure is divided into three panels, each showing a U-shaped tube filled with liquid and two pistons (labeled 1 and 2) with different surface areas (a and A).
  • The left and center panels show pistons at different vertical levels, while the right panel shows pistons at the same horizontal level.

## Left Panel (Pistons at Different Levels, Piston 2 Higher) :  
  • Piston 1 (area a) is lower than piston 2 (area A).
  • Force f is applied to piston 1, and force F is applied to piston 2.
  • The height difference between pistons is h.
  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
  • Formula: f/a = F/A + ρgh.

## Center Panel (Pistons at Different Levels, Piston 2 Lower) :  
  • Piston 1 (area a) is higher than piston 2 (area A).
  • Force f is applied to piston 1, and force F is applied to piston 2.
  • The height difference between pistons is h.
  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
  • Formula: f/a + ρgh = F/A.

## Right Panel (Pistons at Same Level) :  
  • Both pistons are at the same horizontal level.
  • Force f is applied to piston 1, and force F is applied to piston 2.
  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
  • Formula: f/a = F/A.

# Annotations & Text :  
  • Arabic headings: 
    – "المكبسـان في مستويين مختلفين" (The pistons at different levels) for the left and center panels.
    – "المكبسـان في نفس المستوى الأفقي" (The pistons at the same horizontal level) for the right panel.
  • Each panel includes pressure equations and force-area relationships, with or without the hydrostatic term ρgh depending on the height difference.

# Analysis :  
  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at different heights, the pressure relationship includes a hydrostatic term (ρgh) due to the height difference.
  • When pistons are at the same level, the pressure relationship simplifies to Pascal's law (f/a = F/A).
  • The diagrams visually reinforce the effect of height on pressure transmission in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.651,r=0.888,b=0.892), with ID 40796931-54f2-47c8-bbf2-635b559644dc -->
