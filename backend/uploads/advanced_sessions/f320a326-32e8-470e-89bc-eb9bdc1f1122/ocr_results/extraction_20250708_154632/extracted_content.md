Summary : This is a labeled illustration and accompanying explanation of the operation of a hydraulic press, showing how force and pressure are transmitted through a hydraulic fluid between two pistons of different areas.

illustration:
# Diagram Overview :
  • The diagram shows two connected cylinders (left and right) filled with hydraulic fluid (labeled "السائل الهيدروليكي").
  • The left cylinder contains a large piston with area "A" and force "F" applied downward.
  • The right cylinder contains a smaller piston with area "a" and force "f" applied downward.
  • Both pistons are at the same horizontal level, with vertical distances "y1" and "y2" marked.
  • The two cylinders are connected at the base, allowing fluid communication.

# Labels & Notation :
  • Left piston: area "A", force "F", vertical distance "y1".
  • Right piston: area "a", force "f", vertical distance "y2".
  • Both pistons are shown pressing down on the hydraulic fluid.
  • The fluid is labeled "السائل الهيدروليكي" (hydraulic fluid).
  • The diagram is labeled "شكل (1)" (Figure 1).

# Accompanying Explanation (Arabic Text) :
  • Describes the principle of operation: when both pistons are at the same horizontal level, a force "f" is applied to the small piston.
  • This creates a pressure "P" under the small piston: P = f / a.
  • The pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid to the large piston.
  • The resulting force "F" on the large piston is given by F = P × A, or P = F / A.
  • The explanation references Pascal's principle and the transmission of pressure in incompressible fluids.

# Analysis :
  • The illustration and text together explain how a small force applied to a small-area piston can generate a much larger force on a large-area piston via hydraulic pressure.
  • The diagram visually reinforces the mathematical relationships between force, area, and pressure in a hydraulic system.
  • No numerical values are given; the focus is on conceptual understanding and symbolic relationships. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID 8b5c3f3e-994a-4b26-baaf-0d8b7771b694 -->

Summary : This illustration shows a hydraulic system with two connected cylinders of different cross-sectional areas, each fitted with a piston and subjected to different forces.

illustration:
Hydraulic System Overview :
  • Two vertical cylinders are connected at the base, forming a U-shaped container filled with liquid.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with piston area "A" and force "F" applied downward.
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area "a" and force "f" applied downward.
  • Both pistons are shown pressing down on the liquid, with the liquid level equal in both arms.

Labels and Notation :
  • Left piston: area "A", force "F".
  • Right piston: area "a", force "f".
  • Dashed horizontal line indicates equal liquid level.
  • Persian text at the bottom reads "شکل ۲" (Figure 2).

Spatial Relationships :
  • The larger cylinder (left) and smaller cylinder (right) are connected at the base, allowing pressure transmission.
  • Both pistons are at the same vertical height, indicating equilibrium.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually demonstrates Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The system suggests that the ratio of forces to areas (F/A = f/a) is key to the hydraulic mechanism, allowing a small force on the smaller piston to balance a larger force on the larger piston. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.061,t=0.476,r=0.270,b=0.615), with ID 47b86c37-99a1-462e-ad65-cfb6b11558c5 -->

diagram:
# Title & Layout :
  • Title (top right): "حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار" ("States of the Hydraulic Piston at Equilibrium").
  • Three side-by-side schematic diagrams, each with a descriptive heading and associated equations.
  • Left and center diagrams: "المكبان في مستويين مختلفين" ("Pistons at Different Levels").
  • Right diagram: "المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي" ("Pistons at the Same Horizontal Level").

# Diagrams & Labels :
  • Each diagram shows a U-shaped tube filled with liquid, with two pistons (labeled 1 and 2) of different areas (a and A) and forces (f and F) applied.
  • Left and center: Pistons are at different heights, with a height difference h marked.
  • Right: Pistons are at the same horizontal level.
  • All diagrams label the forces (f, F), areas (a, A), and height difference (h) where applicable.

# Equations :
  • Left and center diagrams (different levels): 
    – "P₁ = P₂"
    – "f/a = F/A + ρgh"
    – "f/a + ρgh = F/A"
  • Right diagram (same level): 
    – "P₁ = P₂"
    – "f/a = F/A"
  • ρ (rho) denotes fluid density, g is gravitational acceleration, h is height difference.

# Analysis :
  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the pressure ratio equals the force-to-area ratio (f/a = F/A).
  • When pistons are at different levels, the pressure difference includes a hydrostatic term (ρgh), modifying the force-area relationship.
  • The diagrams and equations together clarify how hydraulic equilibrium depends on piston height and area. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID ed364beb-fa95-4885-ac8b-1c2efae3274c -->
