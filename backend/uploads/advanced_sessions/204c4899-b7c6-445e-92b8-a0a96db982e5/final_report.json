large piston: P = F / A.\n  • The text explains that when the pistons are at the same horizontal level and a force f is applied to the small piston, it creates a pressure P that is transmitted to the large piston, resulting in an upward force F.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The illustration visually demonstrates Pascal's Law: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.\n  • The system shows how a small force on a small area can generate a larger force on a larger area, forming the basis of hydraulic lifts and presses.\n  • The diagram and equations together

piston 2.\n  • Forces: f (on small piston, area a), F (on large piston, area A).\n  • Height difference labeled h.\n  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n  • Equation: f/a = F/A + ρgh.\n\n# Center Diagram

between pistons.\n  • ρ: Fluid density.\n  • g: Acceleration due to gravity.\n  • P₁, P₂: Pressures at pistons 1 and 2.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal for both pistons (f/a = F/A).\n  • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference due to the fluid column (ρgh) must be included in the force balance.\n  • The direction of the ρgh term depends on which piston is higher, as shown by the placement of the term in the equations.\n  • This visualizes Pascal’s principle and the effect of height differences in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID 0c7f1aef-c8a2-40a1-9365-2d3431b7fafe -->\n\nحيث : (ρ) كثافة السائل ، (h) ارتفاع عمود السائل بين

: This figure compares the pressure relationships and equations for two pistons in a U-tube hydraulic system, showing cases where the pistons are at different levels versus the same horizontal level, with corresponding pressure equations.\n\nillustration:\n# Pistons at Different Levels :\n• Two sub-diagrams on the left show pistons labeled \"1\" (area a, force f) and \"2\" (area A, force F) at different heights in a U-tube filled with liquid.\n• The height difference is marked as \"h\".\n• The pressure equality is given as P₁ = P₂.\n• The pressure equation is: f/a = F/A + ρgh.\n\n# Pistons at the Same Horizontal Level :\n• The rightmost diagram shows pistons \"1\" and \"2\" at the same liquid level in the U-tube.\n• The pressure equality is P₁ = P₂.\n• The pressure equation is: f/a = F/A.\n\n# Equations and Annotations :\n• ρ is the liquid density, g is gravitational acceleration, h is the height difference.\n• The diagrams use arrows to indicate the direction of applied forces (f and F) on the pistons.\n• The labels and equations are in Arabic, with clear correspondence between the diagrams and the formulas.\n\n# Analysis :\n• When the pistons are at different heights, the pressure equation includes a hydrostatic term (ρgh) due to the height difference.\n• When the pistons are at the same level, the hydrostatic term vanishes, and the pressure ratio depends only on the force and area ratios.\n• The figure visually and mathematically demonstrates the effect of piston height difference on hydraulic pressure transmission. <!-- figure, from page 0
