Summary : This is a labeled schematic diagram illustrating the operation of a hydraulic fluid system, showing the relationship between force, area, and displacement in two connected pistons of different sizes.

illustration:
System Overview :
  • The diagram shows two vertical cylinders connected at the base, both filled with a hydraulic fluid.
  • The left cylinder contains a large piston with area labeled "A" and force "F" applied upward.
  • The right cylinder contains a smaller piston with area labeled "a" and force "f" applied downward.
  • Both pistons are shown partially submerged in the fluid.

Labels & Annotations :
  • The left piston is labeled with "A" (area) and "F" (force).
  • The right piston is labeled with "a" (area) and "f" (force).
  • Vertical distances are marked as "y2" (left piston) and "y1" (right piston), indicating displacement or height difference.
  • The fluid is labeled as "السانل الهيدروليكي" (hydraulic fluid).
  • The diagram is referenced as "شكل (1)" (Figure 1).

Spatial Relationships :
  • The left piston is larger and higher than the right piston.
  • The two pistons are connected by a U-shaped tube filled with fluid, allowing pressure transmission between them.
  • The forces are applied in opposite directions: upward on the left, downward on the right.

Analysis :
  • The diagram visually demonstrates Pascal's principle, where pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The difference in piston areas and forces suggests a mechanical advantage, typical of hydraulic systems.
  • The labeled heights (y1, y2) indicate the relationship between displacement and force in the system. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.064,t=0.061,r=0.415,b=0.252), with ID 75a31917-1128-48d3-bef4-640bc02863e7 -->

Summary : This illustration demonstrates the principle of hydraulic systems, showing how a force applied to a large piston is transmitted through an incompressible fluid to a smaller piston, resulting in a different force output.

illustration:
Hydraulic System Overview :
  • Two vertical cylinders of different diameters are connected at the base by a U-shaped tube filled with liquid.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with piston area "A" and force "F" applied downward.
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area "a" and force "f" applied downward.
  • Both pistons are shown pressing down on the liquid, with the liquid level equal in both arms.

Labels & Notation :
  • Left piston: "A" (area), "F" (force).
  • Right piston: "a" (area), "f" (force).
  • Dashed line indicates equal liquid level.
  • Persian text at the bottom: "شکل ۲" (Figure 2).

Spatial Relationships :
  • The larger piston (left) and smaller piston (right) are at the same liquid height, indicating pressure transmission.
  • The U-tube ensures the fluid connects both pistons, allowing force transfer.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The system demonstrates how a small force on a small piston can balance a larger force on a larger piston if the ratio of forces equals the ratio of areas (F/A = f/a).
  • The equal liquid levels confirm equilibrium, illustrating the basis for hydraulic multiplication. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.472,r=0.278,b=0.611), with ID 10600c4e-2a7c-49c8-b167-a88ac837f461 -->

Summary : This figure compares the pressure relationships and equations for two pistons in a U-tube hydraulic system, showing cases where the pistons are at different levels versus the same horizontal level, with corresponding pressure equations.

illustration:
# Pistons at Different Levels :
• Two sub-diagrams on the left show pistons labeled "1" (area a, force f) and "2" (area A, force F) at different heights in a U-tube filled with liquid.
• The height difference is marked as "h".
• The pressure equality is given as P₁ = P₂.
• The pressure equation is: f/a = F/A + ρgh.

# Pistons at the Same Horizontal Level :
• The rightmost diagram shows pistons "1" and "2" at the same liquid level in the U-tube.
• The pressure equality is P₁ = P₂.
• The pressure equation is: f/a = F/A.

# Equations and Annotations :
• ρ is the liquid density, g is gravitational acceleration, h is the height difference.
• The diagrams use arrows to indicate the direction of applied forces (f and F) on the pistons.
• The labels and equations are in Arabic, with clear correspondence between the diagrams and the formulas.

# Analysis :
• When the pistons are at different heights, the pressure equation includes a hydrostatic term (ρgh) due to the height difference.
• When the pistons are at the same level, the hydrostatic term vanishes, and the pressure ratio depends only on the force and area ratios.
• The figure visually and mathematically demonstrates the effect of piston height difference on hydraulic pressure transmission. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.651,r=0.888,b=0.892), with ID 8da88e8e-e115-4c80-b10d-617bdccda2b9 -->
