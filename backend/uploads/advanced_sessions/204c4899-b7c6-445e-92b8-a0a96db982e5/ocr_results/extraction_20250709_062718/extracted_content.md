Summary : This is a labeled illustration explaining the principle of hydraulic systems (Pascal's Law) using two connected pistons of different areas submerged in a hydraulic fluid, accompanied by Arabic explanatory text and equations.

illustration:
# System Overview :
  • Two vertical cylinders (pistons) are shown, each with a movable piston at the top.
  • The left cylinder has a large piston with area A and force F applied downward.
  • The right cylinder has a smaller piston with area a and force f applied downward.
  • Both pistons are connected at the base by a U-shaped tube filled with hydraulic fluid (labeled "السائل الهيدروليكي" meaning "hydraulic fluid").
  • The heights y₁ and y₂ are marked from the fluid surface to the bottom of each piston.

# Labels & Notations :
  • Left piston: area A, force F, height y₁.
  • Right piston: area a, force f, height y₂.
  • The fluid is labeled in Arabic.
  • Arrows indicate the direction of applied forces (downward on both pistons).

# Equations & Explanations :
  • The pressure under the small piston: P = f / a.
  • The pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid to the large piston: P = F / A.
  • The text explains that when the pistons are at the same horizontal level and a force f is applied to the small piston, it creates a pressure P that is transmitted to the large piston, resulting in an upward force F.

# Analysis :
  • The illustration visually demonstrates Pascal's Law: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The system shows how a small force on a small area can generate a larger force on a larger area, forming the basis of hydraulic lifts and presses.
  • The diagram and equations together clarify the relationship between force, area, and pressure in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID 5f700d3e-f69e-4949-b86c-cf837fc11eb1 -->

  • Both pistons are shown pressing down on the liquid, with the liquid level equal in both arms.
  • The diagram is labeled "شكل ۲" (Figure 2 in Persian/Arabic numerals).

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or units are provided.
  • The pistons are depicted as solid disks fitting tightly in their respective cylinders.

diagram:
# Title & Layout :
  • Title (top right): "حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار" ("Hydraulic piston states at equilibrium").
  • Three side-by-side schematic diagrams, each with a piston system and associated equations.
  • Left and center diagrams: "المكبان في مستويين مختلفين" ("Pistons at different levels").
  • Right diagram: "المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي" ("Pistons at the same horizontal level").

# Left Diagram (Pistons at Different Levels, piston 1 higher) :
  • Shows two pistons (A and a) at different heights, with piston 1 higher than piston 2.
  • Forces: f (on small piston, area a), F (on large piston, area A).
  • Height difference labeled h.
  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
  • Equation: f/a = F/A + ρgh.

# Center Diagram (Pistons at Different Levels, piston 2 higher) :
  • Similar to left, but piston 2 is higher than piston 1.
  • Forces and areas labeled as above.
  • Height difference h.
  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
  • Equation: f/a + ρgh = F/A.

# Right Diagram (Pistons at Same Level) :
  • Both pistons at the same horizontal level.
  • Forces: f (on small piston, area a), F (on large piston, area A).
  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
  • Equation: f/a = F/A.

# Symbols & Notation :
  • f: Force on small piston (area a).
  • F: Force on large piston (area A).
  • h: Height difference between pistons.
  • ρ: Fluid density.
  • g: Acceleration due to gravity.
  • P₁, P₂: Pressures at pistons 1 and 2.

# Analysis :
  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal for both pistons (f/a = F/A).
  • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference due to the fluid column (ρgh) must be included in the force balance.
  • The direction of the ρgh term depends on which piston is higher, as shown by the placement of the term in the equations.
  • This visualizes Pascal’s principle and the effect of height differences in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID 0c7f1aef-c8a2-40a1-9365-2d3431b7fafe -->
