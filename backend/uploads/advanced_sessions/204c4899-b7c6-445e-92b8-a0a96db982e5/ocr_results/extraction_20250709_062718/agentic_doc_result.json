  "markdown": "Summary : This is a labeled illustration explaining the principle of hydraulic systems (Pascal's Law) using two connected pistons of different areas submerged in a hydraulic fluid, accompanied by Arabic explanatory text and equations.\n\nillustration:\n# System Overview :\n  • Two vertical cylinders (pistons) are shown, each with a movable piston at the top.\n  • The left cylinder has a large piston with area A and force F applied downward.\n  • The right cylinder has a smaller piston with area a and force f applied downward.\n  • Both pistons are connected at the base by a U-shaped tube filled with hydraulic fluid (labeled \"السائل الهيدروليكي\" meaning \"hydraulic fluid\").\n  • The heights y₁ and y₂ are marked from the fluid surface to the bottom of each piston.\n\n# Labels & Notations :\n  • Left piston: area A, force F, height y₁.\n  • Right piston: area a, force f, height y₂.\n  • The fluid is labeled in Arabic.\n  • Arrows indicate the direction of applied forces (downward on both pistons).\n\n# Equations & Explanations :\n  • The pressure under the small piston: P = f / a.\n  • The pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid to the large piston: P = F / A.\n  • The text explains that when the pistons are at the same horizontal level and a force f is applied to the small piston, it creates a pressure P that is transmitted to the large piston, resulting in an upward force F.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The illustration visually demonstrates Pascal's Law: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.\n  • The system shows how a small force on a small area can generate a larger force on a larger area, forming the basis of hydraulic lifts and presses.\n  • The diagram and equations together clarify the relationship between force, area, and pressure in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID 5f700d3e-f69e-4949-b86c-cf837fc11eb1 -->\n\n- إذا

equilibrium states of a hydraulic piston system, showing the relationship between force, area, and pressure when the pistons are at the same or different levels, with corresponding equations.\n\ndiagram:\n# Title & Layout :\n  • Title (top right): \"حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار\" (\"Hydraulic piston states at equilibrium\").\n  • Three side-by-side schematic diagrams, each with a piston system and associated equations.\n  • Left and center diagrams: \"المكبان في مستويين مختلفين\" (\"Pistons at different levels\").\n  • Right diagram: \"المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي\" (\"Pistons at the same horizontal level\").\n\n# Left Diagram (Pistons at Different Levels, piston 1 higher) :\n  • Shows two pistons (A and a) at different heights, with piston 1 higher than piston 2.\n  • Forces: f (on small piston, area a), F (on large piston, area A).\n  • Height difference labeled h.\n  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n  • Equation: f/a = F/A + ρgh.\n\n# Center Diagram (Pistons at Different Levels, piston 2 higher) :\n  • Similar to left, but piston 2 is higher than piston 1.\n  • Forces and areas labeled as above.\n  • Height difference h.\n  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n  • Equation: f/a + ρgh = F/A.\n\n# Right Diagram (Pistons at Same Level) :\n  • Both pistons at the same horizontal level.\n  • Forces: f (on small piston, area a), F (on large piston, area A).\n  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n  • Equation: f/a = F/A.\n\n# Symbols & Notation :\n  • f: Force on small piston (area a).\n  • F: Force on large piston (area A).\n  • h: Height difference between pistons.\n  • ρ: Fluid density.\n  • g: Acceleration due to gravity.\n  • P₁, P₂: Pressures at pistons 1 and 2.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal for both pistons (f/a = F/A).\n  • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference due to the fluid column (ρgh) must be included in the force balance.\n  • The direction of the ρgh term depends on which piston is higher, as shown by the placement of the term in the equations.\n  • This visualizes Pascal’s principle and the effect of height differences in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID 0c7f1aef-c8a2-40a1-9365-2d3431b7fafe -->\n\nحيث : (ρ) كثافة السائل ، (h) ارتفاع عمود السائل بين
