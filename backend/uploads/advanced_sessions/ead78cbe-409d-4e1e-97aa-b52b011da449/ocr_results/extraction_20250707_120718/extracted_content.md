Summary : This image shows the interior of an automotive workshop or service center, featuring multiple cars positioned on hydraulic lifts for maintenance or inspection.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a spacious, well-lit automotive workshop with a high ceiling and large windows.
  • Several cars of various colors (silver, orange, red, blue, black) are visible, with some elevated on blue hydraulic lifts and others parked below.
  • The perspective is from ground level, looking diagonally across the workshop, capturing both foreground and background vehicles.
  • Lighting is bright and diffuse, likely from natural daylight through the large windows and overhead artificial lights.
  • The color palette is dominated by metallic car finishes and the blue of the lift structures.

Technical Details :
  • No visible scale bar or measurement references.
  • No on-image text or UI elements.
  • The hydraulic lifts are two-post types, painted blue, supporting cars at varying heights.
  • The workshop floor is marked with yellow lines, likely indicating parking or work zones.

Spatial Relationships :
  • In the foreground, a silver car is elevated on a lift, with an orange car parked directly beneath it.
  • In the midground, another orange car is raised, with a black car below it.
  • Additional cars are visible in the background, some parked and some on lifts.
  • The arrangement suggests efficient use of vertical space, allowing two cars to occupy the same floor area.

Analysis :
  • The image visually communicates the operational capacity and organization of a modern automotive service center.
  • The use of hydraulic lifts to stack cars vertically maximizes workspace efficiency.
  • The clean, orderly environment and the presence of multiple cars suggest a professional, high-throughput facility. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.004,t=0.161,r=0.712,b=0.512), with ID 7c0d2c97-19c4-46b6-9387-2794ea14ec6a -->

Summary : This is a labeled scientific illustration showing a piston compressing a liquid inside a glass container, with Arabic labels indicating pressure, height, and area.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a vertical glass container filled with liquid.
  • A piston (مكبس) is placed at the top, pressing down on the liquid.
  • The piston is labeled with "Pa" (external pressure).
  • The liquid surface is labeled, and a vertical arrow points downward from the piston to a point "A" at the bottom.
  • The distance from the piston to point "A" is labeled "h".
  • The pressure at the bottom is labeled "P (مكبس)".
  • The container is labeled "إناء زجاجي" (glass vessel).
  • The liquid is labeled "سائل" (liquid).

Technical Details :
  • The illustration uses simple colors: blue for the liquid, beige for the piston, and black for text and arrows.
  • All labels are in Arabic, with some physical quantities (Pa, P, h, A) in Latin script.
  • No scale bar or numerical values are present.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The piston is at the top, directly above the liquid.
  • The vertical arrow and labels indicate the direction of pressure transmission through the liquid.
  • The point "A" is at the bottom center of the container.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains how pressure is applied by a piston to a liquid in a closed container, with pressure transmitted downward to a specific point at depth "h".
  • The labeled variables suggest the setup is used to analyze pressure in fluids, likely for a physics or engineering context. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.055,t=0.579,r=0.245,b=0.724), with ID 35982c99-fe9b-40af-b9f3-9a17156302cc -->

Summary : This image presents the formula for calculating the total pressure at a point in a fluid, accounting for atmospheric pressure, pressure from a piston, and hydrostatic pressure.

formula:
Components :
  • P = Pa + P(مكبس) + ρgh
  • Pa: Atmospheric pressure.
  • P(مكبس): Pressure from a piston (Arabic: مكبس).
  • ρgh: Hydrostatic pressure term, where ρ is fluid density, g is gravitational acceleration, and h is height.

Analysis :
  • The formula expresses that total pressure at a point in a fluid is the sum of atmospheric pressure, any additional pressure from a piston, and the pressure due to the fluid column above the point. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.345,t=0.640,r=0.588,b=0.682), with ID a7759756-475d-4b5c-a7e8-35fde4751ccd -->

Summary : This is a labeled scientific illustration showing a piston-cylinder apparatus used to demonstrate pressure in a liquid, with Arabic annotations for each component.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a vertical glass container (إناء زجاجي) filled with liquid (سائل).
  • A movable piston (مكبس) with a weight (ثقل) on top is fitted into the container.
  • The piston is labeled with atmospheric pressure (Pa) acting downward.
  • The pressure at the bottom of the piston is labeled as P(مكبس).
  • The depth from the piston to a point A at the bottom of the liquid is marked as h.
  • The illustration uses a simple, schematic style with clear lines and Arabic text labels.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or magnification is present.
  • All components are labeled in Arabic: ثقل (weight), مكبس (piston), Pa (atmospheric pressure), إناء زجاجي (glass container), سائل (liquid), P(مكبس) (piston pressure), h (height/depth), and A (point at bottom).
  • The piston is shown as a solid disk with arrows indicating the direction of pressure.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The piston sits horizontally at the top of the liquid, with the weight directly above it.
  • The depth h is measured vertically from the piston to point A at the bottom of the container.
  • Pressure arrows are shown acting downward on the piston and at the bottom of the liquid.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains how pressure is transmitted through a liquid in a closed container with a piston, emphasizing the relationship between applied pressure, depth, and the resulting pressure at a given point in the liquid. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.053,t=0.747,r=0.231,b=0.900), with ID 254eb8ee-84b6-41ea-b105-a2951bc9d596 -->
