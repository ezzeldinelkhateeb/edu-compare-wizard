positioned on hydraulic lifts for maintenance or inspection.\n\nphoto:\nScene Overview :\n  • The main subject is a spacious, well-lit automotive workshop with a high ceiling and large windows.\n  • Several cars of various colors (silver, orange, red, blue, black) are visible, with some elevated on blue hydraulic lifts and others parked below.\n  • The perspective is from ground level, looking diagonally across the workshop, capturing both foreground and background vehicles.\n  • Lighting is bright and diffuse, likely from natural daylight through the large windows and overhead artificial lights.\n  • The color palette is dominated by metallic car finishes and the blue of the lift structures.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No visible scale bar or measurement references.\n  • No on-image text or UI elements.\n  • The hydraulic lifts are two-post types, painted blue, supporting cars at varying heights.\n  • The workshop floor is marked with yellow lines, likely indicating parking or work zones.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • In the foreground, a silver car is elevated on a lift, with an orange car parked directly beneath it.\n  • In the midground, another orange car is raised, with a black car below it.\n  • Additional cars are visible in the background, some parked and some on lifts.\n  • The arrangement suggests efficient use of vertical space, allowing two cars to occupy the same floor area.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The image visually communicates the operational capacity and organization of a modern automotive service center.\n  • The use of hydraulic lifts to stack cars vertically maximizes workspace efficiency.\n  • The clean, orderly environment and the presence of multiple cars suggest a professional, high-throughput facility. <!-- figure, from page 0

container, with Arabic labels indicating pressure, height, and area.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • The main subject is a vertical glass container filled with liquid.\n  • A piston (مكبس) is placed at the top, pressing down on the liquid.\n  • The piston is labeled with \"Pa\" (external pressure).\n  • The liquid surface is labeled, and a vertical arrow points downward from the piston to a point \"A\" at the bottom.\n  • The distance from the piston to point \"A\" is labeled \"h\".\n  • The pressure at the bottom is labeled \"P (مكبس)\".\n  • The container is labeled \"إناء زجاجي\" (glass vessel).\n  • The liquid is labeled \"سائل\" (liquid).\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • The illustration uses simple colors: blue for the liquid, beige for the piston, and black for text and arrows.\n  • All labels are in Arabic, with some physical quantities (Pa, P, h, A) in Latin script.\n  • No scale bar or numerical values are present.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The piston is at the top, directly above the liquid.\n  • The vertical arrow and labels indicate the direction of pressure transmission through the liquid.\n  • The point \"A\" is at the bottom center of the container.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration visually explains how pressure is applied by a piston to a liquid in a closed container, with pressure transmitted downward to a specific point at depth \"h\".\n  • The labeled variables suggest the setup is used to analyze pressure in fluids, likely for a physics or engineering context. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.055,t=0.579,r=0.245,b=0.724), with

piston, and hydrostatic pressure.\n\nformula:\nComponents :\n  • P = Pa + P(مكبس) + ρgh\n  • Pa: Atmospheric pressure.\n  • P(مكبس): Pressure from a piston (Arabic: مكبس).\n  • ρgh: Hydrostatic pressure term, where ρ is fluid density, g is gravitational acceleration, and h is height.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The formula expresses that total pressure at a point in a fluid is the sum of atmospheric pressure, any additional pressure from a piston, and the pressure due to the fluid column above the point. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.345,t=0.640,r=0.588,b=0.682), with ID

bottom of the piston is labeled as P(مكبس).\n  • The depth from the piston to a point A at the bottom of the liquid is marked as h.\n  • The illustration uses a simple, schematic style with clear lines and Arabic text labels.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No scale bar or magnification is present.\n  • All components are labeled in Arabic: ثقل (weight), مكبس (piston), Pa (atmospheric pressure), إناء زجاجي (glass container), سائل (liquid), P(مكبس) (piston pressure), h (height/depth), and A (point at bottom).\n  • The piston is shown as a solid disk with arrows indicating the direction of pressure.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The piston sits horizontally at the top of the liquid, with the weight directly above it.\n  • The depth h is measured vertically from the piston to point A at the bottom of the container.\n  • Pressure arrows are shown acting downward on the piston and at the bottom of the liquid.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration visually explains how pressure is transmitted through a liquid in a closed container with a piston, emphasizing the relationship between applied pressure, depth, and the resulting pressure at a given point in the liquid. <!-- figure,
