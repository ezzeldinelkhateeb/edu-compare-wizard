Summary : This image shows the interior of an automotive workshop or service center, where multiple cars are positioned on hydraulic lifts for maintenance or inspection.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a group of cars inside a large, well-lit automotive workshop.
  • The perspective is from ground level, looking diagonally across the workshop floor.
  • The composition includes several cars, some elevated on blue hydraulic lifts and others parked on the ground.
  • The lighting is bright and diffuse, likely from overhead skylights or large windows.
  • The colour palette features a mix of metallic car colours (silver, orange, red, blue, black) and the blue of the lift structures.

Technical Details :
  • No visible scale bar or measurement units.
  • The hydraulic lifts are two-post types, painted blue, supporting cars at varying heights.
  • No visible text, signage, or user interface elements in the image.

Spatial Relationships :
  • Foreground: A silver car is elevated on a lift, with an orange car parked directly beneath it.
  • Midground: Another orange car is elevated, with a black car beneath it.
  • Background: Additional cars, including a blue and a red one, are visible, some parked and some possibly on lifts.
  • The cars and lifts are arranged in parallel rows, suggesting an organized workshop layout.

Analysis :
  • The image visually communicates the function and organization of a modern automotive service center, highlighting the use of hydraulic lifts to maximize workspace efficiency by allowing cars to be serviced both above and below.
  • The presence of multiple cars in various positions suggests a busy, operational environment. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.004,t=0.161,r=0.712,b=0.512), with ID 8a3d0953-f8a6-4b69-9eb2-c63291fdc5d3 -->

Summary : This is a labeled scientific illustration showing a piston compressing a liquid inside a glass container, with Arabic labels indicating pressure, height, and area.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a vertical cylindrical glass container filled with liquid.
  • A piston (مكبس) is placed at the top, pressing down on the liquid.
  • The piston is labeled with "Pa" (external pressure).
  • The liquid surface is labeled "سائل" (liquid).
  • The container is labeled "إناء زجاجي" (glass vessel).
  • A vertical arrow from the piston to a point at the bottom of the liquid is labeled "h" (height/depth).
  • The bottom point is labeled "A" (area).
  • The pressure at the bottom is labeled "P (مكبس)" (piston pressure).

Technical Details :
  • The illustration uses simple colors: blue for the liquid, beige for the piston, and black for outlines and text.
  • All labels are in Arabic, with some Latin letters for variables (Pa, P, h, A).
  • No scale bar or numerical values are present.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The piston sits horizontally at the top of the liquid, with arrows indicating downward pressure.
  • The height "h" is measured vertically from the piston to the bottom of the liquid.
  • The area "A" is at the base of the container, directly below the piston.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains the concept of pressure transmission in a liquid under a piston, showing how external pressure and depth relate to the pressure at a given point at the bottom of the container. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.055,t=0.579,r=0.245,b=0.724), with ID 65705bb9-3091-4317-af67-bd318b3b9cc9 -->

Summary : This image shows the formula for calculating the total pressure in a fluid system, incorporating atmospheric pressure, pressure from a piston (labelled in Arabic as "مكبس"), and the hydrostatic pressure term.

equation:
  • Formula displayed: P = Pa + P(مكبس) + ρgh

Terms :
  • P: Total pressure.
  • Pa: Atmospheric pressure.
  • P(مكبس): Pressure from the piston (with "مكبس" meaning "piston" in Arabic).
  • ρgh: Hydrostatic pressure term, where ρ is fluid density, g is gravitational acceleration, and h is height.

Design Encodings :
  • All terms are presented in standard mathematical notation.
  • Subscripts and parenthetical labels are used for clarity.
  • The formula is enclosed in a blue-bordered box.

Analysis :
  • The formula combines atmospheric, piston, and hydrostatic pressures to yield the total pressure at a point in a fluid system. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.345,t=0.640,r=0.588,b=0.682), with ID f599d92f-2fb7-4369-be36-36f619eb736d -->

Summary : This is a labeled scientific illustration showing a piston-cylinder apparatus used to demonstrate pressure in a liquid, with Arabic annotations for each component.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a vertical glass container (إناء زجاجي) filled with liquid (سائل).
  • A movable piston (مكبس) with a weight (ثقل) on top is fitted into the container.
  • The piston is labeled with atmospheric pressure (Pa) acting downward.
  • The pressure at the bottom of the piston is labeled as P(مكبس).
  • The vertical distance from the piston to a point A at the bottom of the liquid is marked as h.
  • The point A at the bottom is labeled.

Technical Details :
  • All labels are in Arabic, identifying the piston, weight, glass container, liquid, atmospheric pressure, piston pressure, and height h.
  • No scale bar or magnification is present.
  • The illustration uses simple colors: blue for the liquid, beige for the piston, and gray for the weight.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The piston sits horizontally at the top of the liquid, with the weight directly above it.
  • The pressure arrows (Pa) point downward onto the piston.
  • The height h is measured vertically from the piston to point A at the bottom of the container.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains how pressure is transmitted through a liquid in a closed container with a piston, emphasizing the relationship between applied pressure, liquid depth (h), and the resulting pressure at a specific point (A) in the liquid. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.053,t=0.747,r=0.231,b=0.900), with ID 694fa75f-d3d6-43e9-937e-f769c9621bf9 -->
