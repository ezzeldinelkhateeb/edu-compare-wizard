Summary : This photograph shows the interior of an automotive repair workshop, focusing on two white vehicles—one elevated on a hydraulic lift with its wheels removed, and another on the ground with its hood open. The setting is a modern, well-lit service bay.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subjects: Two white SUVs in a car repair workshop.
  • The upper vehicle is raised on a hydraulic lift, missing all four wheels, exposing brake rotors and undercarriage.
  • The lower vehicle is parked on the ground, hood open, suggesting inspection or maintenance.
  • Perspective: Oblique side view, capturing both vehicles and part of the workshop environment.
  • Lighting: Bright, even fluorescent lighting; no strong shadows.
  • Colour palette: Predominantly neutral—white vehicles, grey and beige workshop walls, red accent lines.

Technical Details :
  • No visible scale bar or measurement references.
  • License plate on the elevated car: “7200AP 136” (partially legible).
  • Workshop equipment visible: tool cabinets, oil containers, air hoses, and a tire on the floor.
  • “KIA” branding on a post, indicating possible dealership or authorized service center.

Spatial Relationships :
  • Elevated car is positioned above and slightly behind the grounded car.
  • The grounded car is closer to the camera, occupying the lower left quadrant.
  • Workshop tools and storage are arranged along the right wall; tire and equipment are on the floor near the lift.

Analysis :
  • The image documents a typical automotive service scenario, highlighting both routine maintenance (open hood) and more extensive repair (wheel removal, car lift).
  • The clean, organized environment and visible branding suggest a professional, possibly dealership-affiliated, service center.
  • The arrangement emphasizes the workshop’s capacity to handle multiple vehicles and types of service simultaneously. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.000,t=0.004,r=0.997,b=0.397), with ID ececf20f-7217-45f3-b82c-7c339ad57c54 -->

Summary : This is a labeled scientific illustration showing a piston (مكبس) pressing down on a liquid inside a glass container (إناء زجاجي), with pressure and height variables annotated in Arabic.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a vertical cylindrical glass container filled with liquid.
  • A piston (مكبس) is fitted at the top, pressing down on the liquid.
  • The piston is labeled with the external pressure Pa (ضغط خارجي).
  • The liquid column beneath the piston is labeled with height h (ارتفاع).
  • The pressure at a point A at the bottom of the liquid is labeled P(مكبس).
  • The container is labeled as "إناء زجاجي" (glass vessel), and the liquid is labeled "سائل" (liquid).
  • The illustration uses arrows to indicate the direction of pressure applied by the piston.

Technical Details :
  • All labels are in Arabic.
  • No scale bar or numerical values are present.
  • The diagram is schematic, not to scale.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The piston is at the top, in direct contact with the liquid surface.
  • The height h is measured vertically from the piston to point A at the bottom.
  • Pressure is shown as acting downward from the piston and at the bottom point A.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains how pressure is transmitted through a liquid by a piston, with pressure increasing with depth (h) and external pressure (Pa) applied at the top.
  • The diagram is suitable for teaching fluid statics or pressure in liquids. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.049,t=0.542,r=0.252,b=0.689), with ID 564f1f17-6826-4280-807f-501105f85efd -->

Summary : This is a labeled scientific illustration showing a piston-cylinder apparatus used to demonstrate pressure in a liquid, with all components annotated in Arabic.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a vertical glass container (إناء زجاجي) filled with liquid (سائل), with a movable piston (مكبس) and a weight (ثقل) placed on top.
  • The piston is shown pressing down on the liquid, with arrows indicating the direction of applied pressure.
  • The setup is depicted in a cross-sectional side view, with clear labeling of each part.

Technical Details :
  • The external pressure above the piston is labeled as Pa.
  • The pressure at a depth h below the surface is labeled as P(عندعمق), meaning "pressure at depth".
  • The depth from the surface to point A is marked as h.
  • Point A is indicated at the bottom of the liquid column.
  • All labels are in Arabic script.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The piston sits horizontally at the top of the liquid, with the weight directly above it.
  • The arrows show pressure being transmitted downward from the piston through the liquid to point A.
  • The depth h is measured vertically from the piston surface to point A at the bottom.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains how pressure is transmitted through a liquid in a closed container, increasing with depth (h) and affected by the applied force (weight) on the piston.
  • The labeled variables (Pa, P(عندعمق), h) set up the basis for discussing hydrostatic pressure and Pascal’s principle. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.050,t=0.708,r=0.240,b=0.869), with ID 7c5fd9fb-dbc5-4b5e-b37f-e37008f8e9ac -->
