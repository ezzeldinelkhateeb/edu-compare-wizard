  "markdown": "Summary : This photograph shows the interior of an automotive repair workshop, focusing on two white vehicles—one elevated on a hydraulic lift with its wheels removed, and another on the ground with its hood open. The setting is a modern, well-lit service bay.\n\nphoto:\nScene Overview :\n  • Main subjects: Two white SUVs in a car repair workshop.\n  • The upper vehicle is raised on a hydraulic lift, missing all four wheels, exposing brake rotors and undercarriage.\n  • The lower vehicle is parked on the ground, hood open, suggesting inspection or maintenance.\n  • Perspective: Oblique side view, capturing both vehicles and part of the workshop environment.\n  • Lighting: Bright, even fluorescent lighting; no strong shadows.\n  • Colour palette: Predominantly neutral—white vehicles, grey and beige workshop walls, red accent lines.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No visible scale bar or measurement references.\n  • License plate on the elevated car: “7200AP 136” (partially legible).\n  • Workshop equipment visible: tool cabinets, oil containers, air hoses, and a tire on the floor.\n  • “KIA” branding on a post, indicating possible dealership or authorized service center.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • Elevated car is positioned above and slightly behind the grounded car.\n  • The grounded car is closer to the camera, occupying the lower left quadrant.\n  • Workshop tools and storage are arranged along the right wall; tire and equipment are on the floor near the lift.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The image documents a typical automotive service scenario, highlighting both routine maintenance (open hood) and more extensive repair (wheel removal, car lift).\n  • The clean, organized environment and visible branding suggest a professional, possibly dealership-affiliated, service center.\n  • The arrangement emphasizes the workshop’s capacity to handle multiple vehicles and types of service simultaneously. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.000,t=0.004,r=0.997,b=0.397), with ID

glass container (إناء زجاجي), with pressure and height variables annotated in Arabic.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • The main subject is a vertical cylindrical glass container filled with liquid.\n  • A piston (مكبس) is fitted at the top, pressing down on the liquid.\n  • The piston is labeled with the external pressure Pa (ضغط خارجي).\n  • The liquid column beneath the piston is labeled with height h (ارتفاع).\n  • The pressure at a point A at the bottom of the liquid is labeled P(مكبس).\n  • The container is labeled as \"إناء زجاجي\" (glass vessel), and the liquid is labeled \"سائل\" (liquid).\n  • The illustration uses arrows to indicate the direction of pressure applied by the piston.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • All labels are in Arabic.\n  • No scale bar or numerical values are present.\n  • The diagram is schematic, not to scale.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The piston is at the top, in direct contact with the liquid surface.\n  • The height h is measured vertically from the piston to point A at the bottom.\n  • Pressure is shown as acting downward from the piston and at the bottom point A.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The illustration visually explains how pressure is transmitted through a liquid by a piston, with pressure increasing with depth (h) and external pressure (Pa) applied at the top.\n  • The diagram is suitable for teaching fluid statics or
