Summary : This is a labeled illustration explaining the principle of hydraulic systems (Pascal's Law) using two connected pistons of different areas submerged in a hydraulic fluid, accompanied by Arabic explanatory text and equations.

illustration:
# System Overview :
  • Two vertical cylinders (pistons) are shown, each with a movable piston at the top.
  • The left cylinder has a large piston with area A and force F applied downward.
  • The right cylinder has a smaller piston with area a and force f applied downward.
  • Both pistons are connected at the base by a U-shaped tube filled with hydraulic fluid (labeled "السائل الهيدروليكي" meaning "hydraulic fluid").
  • The heights y₁ and y₂ are marked from the fluid surface to the bottom of each piston.

# Labels & Notations :
  • Left piston: area A, force F, height y₁.
  • Right piston: area a, force f, height y₂.
  • The fluid is labeled in Arabic.
  • Arrows indicate the direction of applied forces (downward on both pistons).

# Equations & Explanations :
  • The pressure under the small piston: P = f / a.
  • The pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid to the large piston: P = F / A.
  • The text explains that when the pistons are at the same horizontal level and a force f is applied to the small piston, it creates a pressure P that is transmitted to the large piston, resulting in an upward force F.

# Analysis :
  • The illustration visually demonstrates Pascal's Law: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The system shows how a small force on a small area can generate a larger force on a larger area, forming the basis of hydraulic lifts and presses.
  • The diagram and equations together clarify the relationship between force, area, and pressure in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID 5f700d3e-f69e-4949-b86c-cf837fc11eb1 -->

# Right Diagram (Pistons at Same Level) :
  • Both pistons at the same horizontal level.
  • Forces: f (on small piston, area a), F (on large piston, area A).
  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
  • Equation: f/a = F/A.

# Symbols & Notation :
  • f: Force on small piston (area a).
  • F: Force on large piston (area A).
  • h: Height difference between pistons.
  • ρ: Fluid density.

# Analysis :
  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal for both pistons (f/a = F/A).
  • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference due to the fluid column (ρgh) must be included in the force balance.
  • The direction of the ρgh term depends on which piston is higher, as shown by the placement of the term in the equations.
  • This visualizes Pascal’s principle and the effect of height differences in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID 0c7f1aef-c8a2-40a1-9365-2d3431b7fafe -->

Summary : This illustration demonstrates the principle of hydraulic systems, showing how a force applied to a large piston is transmitted through an incompressible fluid to a smaller piston, resulting in a different force output.

illustration:
Hydraulic System Overview :
  • Two vertical cylinders of different diameters are connected at the base by a U-shaped tube filled with liquid.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with piston area "A" and force "F" applied downward.
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area "a" and force "f" applied downward.
  • Both pistons are shown pressing down on the liquid, with the liquid level equal in both arms.

Labels & Notation :
  • Left piston: "A" (area), "F" (force).
  • Right piston: "a" (area), "f" (force).
  • Dashed line indicates equal liquid level.
  • Persian text at the bottom: "شکل ۲" (Figure 2).

Spatial Relationships :
  • The larger piston (left) and smaller piston (right) are at the same liquid height, indicating pressure transmission.
  • The U-tube ensures the fluid connects both pistons, allowing force transfer.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The system demonstrates how a small force on a small piston can balance a larger force on a larger piston if the ratio of forces equals the ratio of areas (F/A = f/a).
  • The equal liquid levels confirm equilibrium, illustrating the basis for hydraulic multiplication. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.472,r=0.278,b=0.611), with ID 10600c4e-2a7c-49c8-b167-a88ac837f461 -->

Summary : This figure compares the pressure relationships and equations for two pistons in a U-tube hydraulic system, showing cases where the pistons are at different levels versus the same horizontal level, with corresponding pressure equations.

illustration:
# Pistons at Different Levels :
• Two sub-diagrams on the left show pistons labeled "1" (area a, force f) and "2" (area A, force F) at different heights in a U-tube filled with liquid.
• The height difference is marked as "h".
• The pressure equality is given as P₁ = P₂.
• The pressure equation is: f/a = F/A + ρgh.

# Pistons at the Same Horizontal Level :
• The rightmost diagram shows pistons "1" and "2" at the same liquid level in the U-tube.
• The pressure equality is P₁ = P₂.
• The pressure equation is: f/a = F/A.

# Equations and Annotations :
• ρ is the liquid density, g is gravitational acceleration, h is the height difference.
• The diagrams use arrows to indicate the direction of applied forces (f and F) on the pistons.
• The labels and equations are in Arabic, with clear correspondence between the diagrams and the formulas.

# Analysis :
• When the pistons are at different heights, the pressure equation includes a hydrostatic term (ρgh) due to the height difference.
• When the pistons are at the same level, the hydrostatic term vanishes, and the pressure ratio depends only on the force and area ratios.
• The figure visually and mathematically demonstrates the effect of piston height difference on hydraulic pressure transmission. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.651,r=0.888,b=0.892), with ID 8da88e8e-e115-4c80-b10d-617bdccda2b9 -->
