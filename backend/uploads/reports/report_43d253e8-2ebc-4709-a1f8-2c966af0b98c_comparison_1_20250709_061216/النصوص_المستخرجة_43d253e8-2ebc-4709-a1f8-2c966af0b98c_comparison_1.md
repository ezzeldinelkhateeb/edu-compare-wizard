Summary : This is a labeled illustration and accompanying explanation of a hydraulic system demonstrating Pascal's principle, showing how force applied to a small piston is transmitted through a hydraulic fluid to a larger piston, resulting in a larger output force.

illustration:
# System Overview :
  • Two connected cylinders (left and right) filled with hydraulic fluid ("السائل الهيدروليكي").
  • Left cylinder has a large piston with area "A" and applied force "F".
  • Right cylinder has a small piston with area "a" and applied force "f".
  • Both pistons are at the same horizontal level (y₁ = y₂).
  • The system is labeled as "شكل 1".

# Labels & Notation :
  • "A" = area of large piston, "a" = area of small piston.
  • "F" = force on large piston, "f" = force on small piston.
  • "y₁", "y₂" = heights of fluid under each piston.
  • "P" = pressure, with equations P = f/a and P = F/A shown.

# Explanatory Text (Arabic) :
  • Describes that when both pistons are at the same level, applying force "f" to the small piston creates a pressure P = f/a.
  • This pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid to the large piston, resulting in an upward force "F" on the large piston, with P = F/A.
  • The explanation references Pascal's law and the transmission of pressure in incompressible fluids.

# Analysis :
  • The figure visually demonstrates Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The system allows a small input force on a small piston to generate a larger output force on a larger piston, proportional to the ratio of their areas.
  • The illustration and equations clarify the mechanical advantage provided by hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID c091bebb-6b10-4d78-a796-ccab83714bda -->

Summary : This illustration demonstrates a hydraulic system with two connected cylinders of different cross-sectional areas, each fitted with a piston and subjected to different applied forces.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The image shows two vertical cylinders connected at the base by a horizontal tube, forming a U-shaped container filled with liquid.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with piston area "A" and applied force "F" directed downward.
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area "a" and applied force "f" also directed downward.
  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.
  • The pistons are depicted as flat disks sealing the tops of the liquid columns.

Technical Details :
  • The left piston is labeled "A" (area) and "F" (force).
  • The right piston is labeled "a" (area) and "f" (force).
  • The liquid is shown as a continuous medium, with the interface at the same height in both cylinders.
  • The diagram is labeled "شكل ۲" (Figure 2) in Persian.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The larger cylinder is on the left, the smaller on the right.
  • Both pistons are at the same vertical level, indicating equal pressure at the interface.
  • The connecting tube allows fluid communication between the two sides.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually represents Pascal's principle, showing how a force applied to a larger area piston (F on A) can be balanced by a smaller force on a smaller area piston (f on a), as long as the pressure (F/A = f/a) is equalized.
  • The system is in static equilibrium, as indicated by the equal fluid levels. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.061,t=0.476,r=0.270,b=0.615), with ID d57ef142-510e-44e2-92c8-1f628e41107c -->

   • Subheading (center): "المكبسان في مستويين مختلفين" ("Pistons at different levels") and "المكبسان في نفس المستوى الأفقي" ("Pistons at the same horizontal level").

# Scenarios & Diagrams :
   ## Left Panel (Pistons at different levels, piston 1 higher):
     • Shows two pistons (A and a) with piston 1 at a higher level than piston 2.
     • Forces: f applied on piston a, F on piston A.
     • Height difference h between pistons.
     • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a = F/A + ρgh.

   ## Middle Panel (Pistons at different levels, piston 2 higher):
     • Similar setup, but piston 2 is higher than piston 1.
     • Forces: f on piston a, F on piston A.
     • Height difference h.
     • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a + ρgh = F/A.

   ## Right Panel (Pistons at same level):
     • Both pistons at the same horizontal level.
     • Forces: f on piston a, F on piston A.
     • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a = F/A.

# Equations :
   • For each scenario, the pressure equality and the relationship between force, area, and height difference (if any) are shown.
   • ρgh term appears only when pistons are at different heights.

# Visual Elements :
   • Each panel contains a U-shaped tube filled with fluid, pistons labeled 1 and 2, and arrows indicating applied forces.
   • Variables: f (small piston force), a (small piston area), F (large piston force), A (large piston area), h (height difference), ρ (fluid density), g (gravity).

# Analysis :
   • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal on both sides (f/a = F/A).
   • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference due to the fluid column (ρgh) must be considered, modifying the force-area relationship.
   • The direction of the ρgh term depends on which piston is higher, as shown in the left and middle panels. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID 00ab2272-5c62-45c8-8d63-189bfae10466 -->

Summary : This is a labeled schematic illustration of a hydraulic fluid system, showing two pistons of different areas connected by a U-shaped tube filled with liquid, used to demonstrate Pascal's principle.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The diagram shows a U-shaped container filled with a liquid, labeled as "السانل الهيدروليكي" (hydraulic fluid).
  • On the left side, a large piston with area "A" is acted upon by a force "F" directed downward.
  • On the right side, a smaller piston with area "a" is acted upon by a force "f" directed downward.
  • The heights of the pistons above a reference level are marked as "y2" (left) and "y1" (right).
  • The pistons are shown as circular disks with vertical arrows indicating the direction of applied forces.

Technical Details :
  • The left piston (area A) is larger than the right piston (area a).
  • The forces F and f are applied vertically downward on the pistons.
  • The vertical distances y2 and y1 are marked with dashed lines, indicating the height of each piston above a common reference.
  • The system is labeled as "شكل (1)" (Figure 1).

Spatial Relationships :
  • The two pistons are connected by the same body of liquid, allowing pressure transmission between them.
  • The left piston is at a higher elevation than the right piston, as indicated by y2 > y1.
  • The pistons are positioned at the open ends of the U-tube.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually demonstrates the principle of hydraulic systems, where a force applied to a larger area piston (A) can be transmitted through an incompressible fluid to produce a different force on a smaller area piston (a), in accordance with Pascal's law.
  • The difference in heights (y2 and y1) may be used to analyze pressure differences or mechanical advantage in the system. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.064,t=0.061,r=0.415,b=0.252), with ID bd7b89ef-0fa3-44fc-9af9-f96c4f98c4fe -->

Summary : This figure compares the pressure relationships and equations for two pistons in a U-tube hydraulic system, showing cases where the pistons are at different levels versus the same horizontal level.

illustration:
# Title & Layout :
  • Title (right): "المكبسـان في نفـس المسـتوى الأفقي" ("The pistons at the same horizontal level").
  • Title (left): "المكبسـان في مسـتويين مختلفين" ("The pistons at different levels").
  • Three side-by-side schematic diagrams, each with labeled pistons, forces, and fluid columns.
  • Each diagram is accompanied by pressure equations.

# Left Section (Pistons at Different Levels, Case 1) :
  • Shows a U-tube with piston 1 (area a, force f) at a lower level than piston 2 (area A, force F).
  • Fluid height difference h is marked.
  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
  • Equation: f/a = F/A + ρgh.

# Middle Section (Pistons at Different Levels, Case 2) :
  • Similar U-tube, but piston 1 is now at a higher level than piston 2.
  • Fluid height difference h is marked.
  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
  • Equation: f/a + ρgh = F/A.

# Right Section (Pistons at Same Level) :
  • U-tube with both pistons at the same horizontal level.
  • No height difference.
  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
  • Equation: f/a = F/A.

# Symbols & Notation :
  • f: Force applied on piston 1 (area a).
  • F: Force applied on piston 2 (area A).
  • ρ: Fluid density.
  • g: Acceleration due to gravity.
