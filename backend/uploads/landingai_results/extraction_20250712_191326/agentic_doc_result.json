one small) connected by a tube filled with hydraulic fluid (سائل هيدروليكي).\n  • The left piston (A) has a larger cross-sectional area; the right piston (a) is smaller.\n  • Both pistons are labeled, and the fluid level is indicated.\n\n# Explanatory Sections :\n## التركيب (Structure) :\n  • Two connected cylinders: one with a small cross-sectional area (a), the other with a large area (A).\n  • The space between the pistons is filled with a suitable hydraulic fluid.\n\n## الوظيفة (Function) :\n  • To obtain a large force on the large piston by applying a small force to the small piston.\n\n## فكرة العمل (Working Principle) :\n  • Based on Pascal’s Law (قاعدة باسكال).\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The diagram and text together illustrate how a small force applied to the small piston is transmitted via incompressible hydraulic fluid to produce a larger force on the larger piston, demonstrating the mechanical advantage of hydraulic systems as governed by Pascal’s Law. <!-- figure,

      "text": "Summary : This is a labeled diagram and explanatory text describing the structure, function, and working principle of a hydraulic press (المكبس الهيدروليكي), including a schematic of two connected pistons of different cross-sectional areas filled with hydraulic fluid.\n\nillustration:\n# Schematic Diagram :\n  • Shows two pistons (one large, one small) connected by a tube filled with hydraulic fluid (سائل هيدروليكي).\n  • The left piston (A) has a larger cross-sectional area; the right piston (a) is smaller.\n  • Both pistons are labeled, and the fluid level is indicated.\n\n# Explanatory Sections :\n## التركيب (Structure) :\n  • Two connected cylinders: one with a small cross-sectional area (a), the other with a large area (A).\n  • The space between the pistons is filled with a suitable hydraulic fluid.\n\n## الوظيفة (Function) :\n  • To obtain a large force on the large piston by applying a small force to the small piston.\n\n## فكرة العمل (Working Principle) :\n  • Based on Pascal’s Law (قاعدة باسكال).\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The diagram and text together illustrate how a small force applied to the small piston is transmitted via incompressible hydraulic fluid to produce a larger force on the larger piston, demonstrating the mechanical advantage of hydraulic systems as governed by Pascal’s Law.",
