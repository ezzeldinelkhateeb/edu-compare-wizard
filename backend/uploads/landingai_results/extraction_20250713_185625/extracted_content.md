Summary : This figure illustrates the structure and characteristics of "anticline folds" (الطيات المحدبة) in geology, showing both a 3D block diagram and a cross-sectional view, with Arabic labels and explanatory notes.

illustration:
# 3D Block Diagram (Left) :
  • Shows a block of layered rock strata bent upwards into an arch shape.
  • Layers are color-coded to distinguish different strata.
  • Key labels:
    – "محور" (axis): Dashed line along the crest of the fold.
    – "مستوى محوري" (axial plane): Vertical plane dividing the fold symmetrically.
    – "جناح (جانب)" (limb/side): The flanks of the fold on either side of the axis.

# Cross-Sectional View (Right) :
  • Depicts a vertical slice through the fold, highlighting the arching of the layers.
  • Key labels:
    – "محور" (axis): Line at the crest of the fold.
    – "مستوى محوري" (axial plane): Vertical dividing plane.
    – "جناح (جانب)" (limb/side): Sides of the fold.

# Explanatory Notes (Top Right) :
  • Title: "الطيات المحدبة" (Anticline Folds).
  • Bulleted points:
    – "الطبقات منحنية لأعلى." (Layers are bent upwards.)
    – "أقدم الطبقات توجد في المركز." (The oldest layers are found at the center.)
    – "يتقارب الجناحان من أعلى." (The limbs converge at the top.)

# Analysis :
  • The diagrams clarify that anticline folds are characterized by upward-arching layers, with the oldest rocks at the core and limbs dipping away from the axis.
  • The axial plane divides the fold symmetrically, and the limbs are mirror images on either side.
  • The visual distinction between 3D and cross-sectional views aids in understanding the spatial geometry of anticlines. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.087,t=0.170,r=0.927,b=0.504), with ID 40f797b3-c889-46cc-8822-43f59728c557 -->

Summary : This figure illustrates the structure and characteristics of synclinal folds (الطيات المقعرة) in geology, showing both a 3D block diagram and a cross-sectional view, with Arabic annotations describing the orientation and arrangement of rock layers.

illustration:
# 3D Block Diagram :
  • Depicts a synclinal fold with multiple colored layers bent downward.
  • The central layers are the youngest, located at the core of the fold.
  • Labels include: "محور" (axis), "مستوى محوري" (axial plane), and "جناح (جانب)" (limb/side).
  • The limbs converge downward toward the axis.

# Cross-Sectional View :
  • Shows a vertical slice through the fold, highlighting the downward curvature.
  • The axial plane and axis are marked, as well as the limbs.
  • The youngest layers are at the center, with older layers outward.

# Annotations & Explanatory Text :
  • Title: "الطيات المقعرة" (Synclinal Folds).
  • Bulleted points:
    • "الطبقات منحنية لأسفل." (Layers are bent downward.)
    • "أحدث الطبقات توجد في المركز." (The youngest layers are in the center.)
    • "يقترب الجناحان من أسفل." (The limbs converge downward.)

Analysis :
  • The diagrams clearly show that in synclinal folds, rock layers dip toward the fold axis, with the youngest strata at the core.
  • The 3D and cross-sectional views together clarify the spatial relationships and geometry of synclines, emphasizing the downward curvature and central positioning of the youngest layers. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.088,t=0.531,r=0.929,b=0.867), with ID 2f4b66aa-480c-489f-9a9c-189bb565bf19 -->
