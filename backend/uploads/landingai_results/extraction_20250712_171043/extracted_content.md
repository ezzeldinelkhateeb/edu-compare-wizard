Summary : This is a labeled illustration explaining the operation of a hydraulic press (Pascal's principle) with two pistons of different areas, accompanied by Arabic text describing the process and relevant equations.

illustration:
# Diagram Overview :
  • Shows two connected cylinders filled with hydraulic fluid, each with a piston: a large piston (area A, force F) on the left and a small piston (area a, force f) on the right.
  • The pistons are at the same horizontal level.
  • The left piston is labeled with area "A" and force "F" applied upward; the right piston is labeled with area "a" and force "f" applied downward.
  • Heights y1 and y2 are marked from the fluid surface to the pistons.
  • The system is labeled as "السائل الهيدروليكي" (hydraulic fluid).
  • The diagram is labeled as "(شكل 1)" (Figure 1).

# On-Image Equations and Labels :
  • Pressure at the small piston: P = f / a
  • Pressure at the large piston: P = F / A

# Accompanying Arabic Text (Summary) :
  • Describes that when the pistons are at the same horizontal level, the force f applied to the small piston creates a pressure P = f / a.
  • This pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid to the large piston, resulting in an upward force F on the large piston, given by F = P × A or P = F / A.
  • Explains the principle of pressure transmission in hydraulic systems (Pascal's law).

# Analysis :
  • The illustration visually demonstrates Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished to all parts of the fluid and to the walls of its container.
  • The diagram and equations show how a small force applied to a small-area piston can generate a larger force on a larger-area piston, forming the basis of hydraulic multiplication. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.065,t=0.069,r=0.913,b=0.240), with ID 094b5988-e667-446d-b031-1bdf3fba16cb -->

Summary : This illustration demonstrates the principle of hydraulic systems, showing how a force applied to a large piston is transmitted through a fluid to a smaller piston, resulting in a different force output.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The image shows two vertical cylinders of different diameters connected at the base by a U-shaped tube filled with liquid.
  • The left cylinder has a larger piston labeled "A" with a downward force "F" applied.
  • The right cylinder has a smaller piston labeled "a" with a downward force "f" applied.
  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.
  • The diagram is labeled in Persian as "شکل ۲" (Figure 2).

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or units are provided.
  • The pistons are depicted as solid disks fitting tightly in their respective cylinders.
  • The forces are indicated by arrows pointing downward on each piston.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The larger piston (A) is on the left, the smaller piston (a) is on the right.
  • The connecting tube allows fluid to transmit pressure between the two pistons.
  • The fluid surface is continuous and level across both cylinders.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The difference in piston areas (A > a) means the forces (F and f) are related by the ratio of their areas, demonstrating mechanical advantage in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.476,r=0.267,b=0.616), with ID b0c0ca73-346c-45e8-8b02-1e42c03e3cf9 -->

Summary : This figure illustrates the equilibrium states of a hydraulic press (hydraulic piston system) under different configurations, showing the relationship between forces, areas, and fluid pressure, with corresponding equations for each case.

diagram:
# Title :
   • "حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار" (States of the Hydraulic Piston at Equilibrium).

# Configurations :
   ## Left Panel – Pistons at Different Levels :
     • Shows two pistons (1 and 2) at different vertical heights, with piston 1 lower than piston 2.
     • Small force f applied on area a (piston 1), large force F on area A (piston 2).
     • Height difference h between fluid surfaces.
     • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a = F/A + ρgh.

   ## Middle Panel – Pistons at Different Levels (Force on Opposite Side) :
     • Similar to left panel but with force f applied downward on piston 1 and F upward on piston 2.
     • Height difference h is maintained.
     • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a + ρgh = F/A.

   ## Right Panel – Pistons at Same Level :
     • Both pistons at the same horizontal level.
     • Forces f and F applied vertically downward on pistons 1 and 2, respectively.
     • No height difference (h = 0).
     • Equation: P₁ = P₂, f/a = F/A.

# Visual Elements :
   • Each panel contains a U-shaped tube filled with fluid, with pistons and labeled forces.
   • Labels: a (area of small piston), A (area of large piston), f (small force), F (large force), h (height difference), ρ (fluid density), g (acceleration due to gravity).
   • Dotted lines indicate fluid levels for reference.

# Analysis :
   • The figure demonstrates how the pressure equilibrium in a hydraulic system depends on the relative heights of the pistons and the applied forces.
   • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference due to fluid column (ρgh) must be considered in the force-area relationship.
   • When pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal on both sides, showing the basic principle of hydraulic multiplication.
   • The equations summarize the conditions for equilibrium in each scenario. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.121,t=0.625,r=0.891,b=0.905), with ID 77ca47f0-605c-4ef4-b396-0ef8866f5552 -->
