Summary : This figure illustrates the structure and characteristics of "anticline folds" (الطيات المحدبة) in geology, showing both a 3D block diagram and a cross-sectional view, with Arabic annotations describing the main features.

illustration:
# 3D Block Diagram (Left) :
  • Shows a rectangular block with multiple colored layers, each representing a geological stratum.
  • The layers are arched upwards, forming a convex shape.
  • Key labels: "محور" (axis), "مستوى محوري" (axial plane), "جناح (جانب)" (limb/side).
  • The oldest layers are at the core (center) of the fold.

# Cross-Sectional View (Right) :
  • Depicts a vertical slice through the fold, revealing the internal arrangement of layers.
  • The layers curve upward, with the axis and axial plane clearly marked.
  • Labels: "محور" (axis), "مستوى محوري" (axial plane), "جناح (جانب)" (limb/side).

# Annotations (Top Right) :
  • Title: "الطيات المحدبة" (Anticline Folds).
  • Bulleted points:
    • "الطبقات منحنية لأعلى." (Layers are bent upwards.)
    • "أقدم الطبقات توجد في المركز." (The oldest layers are found at the center.)
    • "يتقارب الجناحان من أعلى." (The limbs converge at the top.)

Analysis :
  • The figure visually explains the geometry of anticline folds, emphasizing that the oldest rock layers are at the core and the limbs dip away from the center.
  • The combination of 3D and cross-sectional views aids in understanding both the surface and internal structure of anticlines.
  • The Arabic annotations reinforce the key diagnostic features of anticline folds for educational purposes. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.087,t=0.170,r=0.927,b=0.504), with ID 2c8ce3f1-e3be-4610-88d0-2c2abbf48f41 -->

Summary : This figure illustrates the structure and characteristics of synclinal folds (الطيات المقعرة) in geology, showing both a 3D block diagram and a cross-sectional view, with Arabic annotations describing the main features.

illustration:
# 3D Block Diagram :
  • Depicts a synclinal fold with multiple colored layers bent downward.
  • The central layers are the youngest, located at the core of the fold.
  • Labels include: "محور" (axis), "مستوى محوري" (axial plane), and "جناح (جانب)" (limb/side).
  • The limbs converge downward toward the axis.

# Cross-Sectional View :
  • Shows a vertical slice through the fold, highlighting the downward curvature of the layers.
  • The axial plane and axis are marked, as well as the limbs.
  • The diagram emphasizes the concave-upward shape typical of synclines.

# Annotations (Arabic Text) :
  • Title: "الطيات المقعرة" (Synclinal Folds).
  • Key points:
    • "الطبقات منحنية لأسفل." (Layers are bent downward.)
    • "أحدث الطبقات توجد في المركز." (The youngest layers are found in the center.)
    • "يقترب الجناحان من أسفل." (The two limbs converge downward.)

Analysis :
  • The diagrams clearly distinguish the geometry of synclinal folds, emphasizing the downward bending of layers and the central position of the youngest strata.
  • The combination of 3D and cross-sectional views aids in visualizing both the surface and internal structure of the fold.
  • The Arabic annotations reinforce the key diagnostic features of synclines for educational purposes. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.088,t=0.531,r=0.929,b=0.867), with ID d5382cc7-a0ad-480c-862f-c9f21f0e6c83 -->
