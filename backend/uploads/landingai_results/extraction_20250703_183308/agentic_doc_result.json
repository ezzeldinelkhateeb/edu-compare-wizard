axes are drawn as arrows.\n  • Four subplots, each labeled with an Arabic letter: (د), (ج), (ب), (ا) from left to right.\n\nData Points :\n  • (د): Red curve, downward-sloping, concave upward (decreasing, nonlinear).\n  • (ج): Red straight line, steep positive slope (increasing, linear).\n  • (ب): Red straight line, moderate positive slope (increasing, linear).\n  • (ا): Red straight line, shallow positive slope (increasing, linear).\n\nDesign Encodings :\n  • All graphs use blue axes and a red curve or line.\n  • Each subplot is labeled with a circled Arabic letter below the x-axis.\n  • No gridlines, markers, or additional annotations.\n\nDistribution & Trends :\n  • (د): y₂ decreases rapidly as y₁ increases (inverse relationship).\n  • (ج), (ب), (ا): All show direct proportionality, but with different slopes (steepest in ج, shallowest in ا).\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The figure is designed to test understanding of the mathematical relationship between the displacements of two pistons in a hydraulic system, offering options for both inverse and direct proportionality, as well as different slopes for the direct cases.\n  • Only (د) shows a nonlinear, inverse relationship; the others are linear with varying slopes.\n  • The correct choice would depend on the physical law governing hydraulic pistons (usually inverse proportionality if area is constant and volume is conserved). <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.069,t=0.197,r=0.927,b=0.384), with ID d0152336-f481-4393-9f26-1d2490feccbd -->\n\n١٠ إذا كانت النسبة بين قطري مكبسي المكبس الهيدروليكي هي $\\frac{٥}{١}$، فإن نسبة الضغط عند المكبس الصغير إلى الضغط الناتج عند المكبس الكبير في حالة اتزان المكبسين في مستوى أفقي واحد هي ........\n\n(أ) $\\frac{١}{٥}$\n\n(ب) $\\frac{٥}{١}$\n\n(ج) $\\frac{١}{١}$\n\n(د) $\\frac{٢٥}{١}$\n\n(سمود / الغربية ٢٣) <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.073,t=0.390,r=0.929,b=0.479), with ID c5b50590-f6ec-4b02-b200-953cd00d3138 -->\n\n١١ إذا كانت النسبة بين نصفى قطرى أسطوانتى المكبس الهيدروليكى  $\\frac{5}{2}$ ، فإن الفائدة الآلية للمكبس تساوى ........\n\n(أ) $\\frac{5}{2}$    (ب) $\\frac{25}{4}$    (ج) $\\frac{2}{5}$    (د) $\\frac{4}{25}$\n\n(كفر الدوار / البحيرة ٢٤) <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.075,t=0.483,r=0.928,b=0.552), with ID cffe265c-29f9-4953-99ec-83d6a5b7b2f9 -->\n\n١٢ إذا كانت الفائدة الآلية لكبس هيدروليكي تساوي ٢٥٠ ومساحة المكبس الصغير ٢.٥ cm² فإن نصف قطر المكبس الكبير يساوي ........\n\n١٤.١ cm ⓘ      ١٠٠ cm ⓞ      ١٩٨.٨١ cm ⓞ      ٦٢٥ cm ⓞ\n\n(أزمنت / الأقصر ٢٤) <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.072,t=0.555,r=0.929,b=0.639), with ID 9b26786a-45e0-4bb2-9d5d-a1759eb12918 -->\n\nSummary : This is a physics illustration showing a hydraulic press system with two pistons of different areas, a liquid of density ρ, and a mass m placed on the larger piston.
