ملاحظة

* تخضع السوائل لقاعدة باسكال بينما لا تخضع الغازات لها.
لأن السوائل غيرقابلة للانضغاط فينتقل الضغط المؤثر عليها بتمامه إلى جميع أجزاء السائل، أما الغازات قابلة للانضغاط لوجود مسافات بينية كبيرة نسبياً بين جزيئات الغاز فيستهلك جزء من الشغل المبذول لضغط جزيئات الغاز وبالتالى ينتقل الضغط جزئياً خلال الغازات. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.082,t=0.205,r=0.931,b=0.346), with ID 7ad7d0ad-5af9-4620-9d4f-428033e33cb5 -->

Summary : This figure explains the structure, function, and working principle of a hydraulic press (المكبس الهيدروليكي) using a labeled diagram and descriptive text in Arabic.

illustration:
# Diagram :
  • Shows a U-shaped tube filled with hydraulic fluid (السائل الهيدروليكي).
  • The tube connects two pistons: one with a small cross-sectional area (a) and one with a large cross-sectional area (A).
  • The pistons are labeled as "a" (small) and "A" (large).

# Structure (التركيب) :
  • The system consists of two pistons connected by a tube.
  • One piston has a small cross-sectional area (a), the other a large area (A).
  • The space between the pistons is filled with a suitable hydraulic fluid.

# Function (الوظيفة) :
  • The device is used to obtain a large force on the large piston by applying a small force to the small piston.

# Working Principle (فكرة العمل) :
  • Based on Pascal's principle (قاعدة باسكال).

Analysis :
  • The illustration and text together clarify how a small force applied to a small piston can generate a much larger force on a larger piston, thanks to the incompressibility of the hydraulic fluid and Pascal's law. The diagram visually supports the explanation by showing the relative sizes of the pistons and the connecting fluid. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.641,r=0.937,b=0.922), with ID 2d281fbd-0a1c-4cee-b044-0750c991df04 -->
