Summary : This is a labeled illustration and explanatory text describing the operation of a hydraulic press, showing how force and pressure are transmitted through a hydraulic fluid between two pistons of different areas.

illustration:
# Diagram Overview :
  • The diagram shows two connected cylinders filled with hydraulic fluid, each with a piston: a large piston (area A, force F) and a small piston (area a, force f).
  • The pistons are at the same horizontal level.
  • The large piston is labeled with area A and force F applied upward; the small piston is labeled with area a and force f applied downward.
  • Vertical distances y₁ and y₂ are marked, corresponding to the heights moved by each piston.
  • The system is labeled as "السائل الهيدروليكي" (hydraulic fluid).
  • The diagram is labeled as (شكل 1) (Figure 1).

# Key Equations and Explanations :
  • When the pistons are at the same horizontal level, a force f applied to the small piston creates a pressure P at its base: P = f / a.
  • This pressure is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid to the base of the large piston.
  • The same pressure P acts on the large piston, producing an upward force F: P = F / A.
  • The text explains that the pressure is distributed equally to all parts of the fluid and to the bottom surface of the large piston, causing it to move upward.

# Technical Details :
  • The explanation is in Arabic.
  • The diagram is simple, with clear labels for forces, areas, and distances.
  • The equations P = f / a and P = F / A are shown explicitly.

Analysis :
  • The illustration demonstrates Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished in all directions.
  • The system allows a small force applied to a small piston to generate a larger force on a larger piston, illustrating the mechanical advantage of hydraulic systems.
  • The diagram and equations together clarify the relationship between force, area, and pressure in hydraulic presses. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.065,t=0.069,r=0.913,b=0.240), with ID c8ce0240-0793-45c8-b340-2f1e2613d840 -->

- إذا تسببت القوة F في تحريك المكبس الصغير مسافة y1 لأسفل فإن المكبس الكبير يتأثر بقوة F وتسبب تحركه مسافة y2 لأعلى، ويطبق قانون بقاء الطاقة (في حالة المكبس الهيدروليكي المثالي) فإن :

Summary : This illustration demonstrates a hydraulic system with two connected cylinders of different cross-sectional areas, each fitted with a piston and filled with liquid, to show the principle of hydraulic force multiplication.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Two vertical cylinders are connected at the base by a horizontal tube, forming a U-shaped vessel filled with liquid.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with piston area "A" and downward force "F" applied on its piston.
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area "a" and downward force "f" applied on its piston.
  • The liquid levels in both cylinders are equal, indicating equilibrium.
  • The pistons are depicted as flat disks fitting tightly in their respective cylinders.

Technical Details :
  • The left piston is labeled "A" (large area), the right piston "a" (small area).
  • Forces are indicated by arrows: "F" on the left piston, "f" on the right piston.
  • The liquid is shown as a continuous medium, with the same height in both arms.
  • The diagram is labeled "شكل ۲" (Figure 2) in Persian at the bottom.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The larger cylinder is on the left, the smaller on the right.
  • Both pistons are at the same vertical height, with the liquid surface level between them.
  • The connecting tube is at the base, ensuring pressure transmission between the two sides.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The system demonstrates how a small force "f" applied to a small area "a" can balance a larger force "F" on a larger area "A", illustrating hydraulic multiplication (F/A = f/a).
  • The equal liquid levels confirm equilibrium, supporting the concept of pressure equality at the same depth. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.476,r=0.267,b=0.616), with ID ff00a602-1ddc-422a-b619-e9194fb98be6 -->

# Title :
  • Main title (top right): "حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار" ("States of the Hydraulic Press at Equilibrium").
  • Subtitles for each configuration:
    – Left and center: "المكبان في مستويين مختلفين" ("The pistons at different levels").
    – Right: "المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي" ("The pistons at the same horizontal level").

# Configurations :
  ## Left Panel (Pistons at Different Levels, F on Right Piston) :
    • Shows two pistons (left: small area a, right: large area A) at different fluid heights.
    • Force f applied downward on left piston, force F applied downward on right piston.
    • Height difference h between fluid surfaces.
    • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
    • Equation: f/a = F/A + ρgh.

  ## Center Panel (Pistons at Different Levels, F on Left Piston) :
    • Similar setup as left panel, but force F is now on the left piston (area a), and force f on the right piston (area A).
    • Height difference h remains.
    • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
    • Equation: f/a + ρgh = F/A.

  ## Right Panel (Pistons at Same Level) :
    • Both pistons at the same horizontal fluid level.
    • Force f on left piston (area a), force F on right piston (area A).
    • No height difference.
    • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
    • Equation: f/a = F/A.

# Visual Elements :
  • Each panel contains a U-shaped tube filled with fluid, with pistons labeled and arrows indicating force directions.
  • Fluid levels and height differences are clearly marked.
  • Mathematical equations are shown below each diagram.

# Analysis :
  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal on both sides (f/a = F/A).
  • When pistons are at different heights, the hydrostatic pressure difference (ρgh) must be included in the force balance.
  • The diagrams and equations together clarify how hydraulic systems transmit force and how fluid height differences affect pressure equilibrium. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.121,t=0.625,r=0.891,b=0.905), with ID e96acd8e-b625-489e-bc7c-e02cf3b79daf -->
