Summary : This is a labeled illustration and explanatory text describing the operation of a hydraulic press, showing how force and pressure are transmitted through a hydraulic fluid between two pistons of different areas.

illustration:
# Diagram :
  • Shows two connected cylinders filled with hydraulic fluid, each with a piston (one large, one small).
  • The left cylinder has a large piston labeled "A" with an upward force "F" applied.
  • The right cylinder has a small piston labeled "a" with a downward force "f" applied.
  • Heights "y1" and "y2" are marked to indicate fluid levels or piston positions.
  • The system is labeled as "السائل الهيدروليكي" (hydraulic fluid).
  • The diagram is labeled as "(شكل 1)" (Figure 1).

# Equations and Explanations :
  • States that when the pistons are at the same horizontal level, a force "f" applied to the small piston creates a pressure P = f/a at the bottom of the small piston.
  • This pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid to the bottom of the large piston.
  • The same pressure acts on the large piston, producing an upward force F, given by P = F/A.
  • The text explains the principle of pressure transmission in hydraulic systems.

# Analysis :
  • The figure visually demonstrates Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished in all directions.
  • The equations show how a small force on a small-area piston can generate a larger force on a larger-area piston, explaining the mechanical advantage of hydraulic presses.
  • The diagram and text together clarify the relationship between force, area, and pressure in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.065,t=0.069,r=0.913,b=0.240), with ID 6eb9fe7d-5eac-4210-ad89-19fc36afb20d -->

- إذا تسببت القوة F في تحريك المكبس الصغير مسافة 𝑦₁ لأسفل فإن المكبس الكبير يتأثر بقوة F وتسبب تحركه مسافة 𝑦₂ لأعلى، ويطبق قانون بقاء الطاقة (في حالة المكبس الهيدروليكي المثالي) فإن :

Summary : This illustration demonstrates the principle of hydraulic systems, showing how a force applied to a large piston is transmitted through an incompressible fluid to a smaller piston, resulting in a different force output.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The image shows two vertical cylinders of different diameters connected at the base by a U-shaped tube filled with liquid.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with area "A" and force "F" applied downward on a piston.
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with area "a" and force "f" applied downward on a smaller piston.
  • The liquid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.
  • The diagram is labeled "شكل ۲" (Figure 2 in Persian).

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or units are provided.
  • The pistons are shown as solid disks fitting tightly in their respective cylinders.
  • The forces F and f are indicated by downward arrows.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The larger piston (A) is on the left, the smaller piston (a) is on the right.
  • Both pistons are at the same vertical height, suggesting equal pressure transmission through the fluid.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The system demonstrates how a small force applied to a small area can balance a larger force applied to a larger area, or vice versa, depending on the area ratio. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.476,r=0.267,b=0.616), with ID bf17f87e-df61-4466-bc6f-1a7526055601 -->

Summary : This figure illustrates the equilibrium states of a hydraulic press (hydraulic piston system) under different configurations, showing the relationship between forces, areas, and fluid pressure when the pistons are at the same or different heights.

diagram:
# Title :
  • "حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار" (States of the Hydraulic Press at Equilibrium).

# Configurations :
  ## Left Panel – Pistons at Different Levels (المكبان في مستويين مختلفين) :
    • Diagram shows two pistons (left: small area a, right: large area A) at different heights, with the right piston higher.
    • Forces: Small force f applied on left piston, large force F on right piston.
    • Height difference h between fluid surfaces.
    • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
    • Equation: f/a = F/A + ρgh.

  ## Middle Panel – Pistons at Different Levels (المكبان في مستويين مختلفين) :
    • Diagram similar to left, but right piston is lower than left.
    • Forces: f on left, F on right.
    • Height difference h, but now right piston is lower.
    • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
    • Equation: f/a + ρgh = F/A.

  ## Right Panel – Pistons at Same Level (المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي) :
    • Both pistons at the same horizontal level.
    • Forces: f on left, F on right.
    • No height difference.
    • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
    • Equation: f/a = F/A.

# Visual Elements :
  • Each panel contains a U-shaped tube filled with fluid, with pistons labeled 1 (left, area a) and 2 (right, area A).
  • Arrows indicate direction of applied forces.
  • Dotted lines show fluid levels.
  • Variables: f, F (forces); a, A (areas); h (height difference); ρ (fluid density); g (gravity).

# Analysis :
  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal on both sides (f/a = F/A).
  • When pistons are at different heights, the hydrostatic pressure difference (ρgh) must be included in the force balance.
  • The equations summarize how pressure transmission in a hydraulic system depends on both force/area and fluid height differences, consistent with Pascal’s principle. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.121,t=0.625,r=0.891,b=0.905), with ID 4072702a-d73e-41f6-8f86-6b0131809d97 -->
