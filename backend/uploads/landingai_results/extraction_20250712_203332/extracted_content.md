ملاحظة

* تخضع السوائل لقاعدة باسكال بينما لا تخضع الغازات لها.
لأن السوائل غيرقابلة للانضغاط فينتقل الضغط المؤثر عليها بتمامه إلى جميع أجزاء السائل، أما الغازات قابلة للانضغاط لوجود مسافات بينية كبيرة نسبياً بين جزيئات الغاز فيستهلك جزء من الشغل المبذول لضغط جزيئات الغاز وبالتالي ينتقل الضغط جزئياً خلال الغازات. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.082,t=0.205,r=0.931,b=0.346), with ID 141dc131-bfc1-4158-98cc-008e7108d8af -->

Summary : This is a labeled diagram and explanatory text describing the structure, function, and working principle of a hydraulic press (المكبس الهيدروليكي), including a schematic of two connected pistons of different cross-sectional areas filled with hydraulic fluid.

illustration:
# Schematic Diagram :
  • Shows two pistons (one large, one small) connected by a tube filled with hydraulic fluid (سائل هيدروليكي).
  • The left piston (A) has a larger cross-sectional area; the right piston (a) is smaller.
  • Both pistons are labeled, and the fluid level is indicated.

# Explanatory Sections :
## التركيب (Structure) :
  • Two connected pistons: one with a small cross-sectional area (a), the other with a large area (A).
  • The space between the pistons is filled with a suitable hydraulic fluid.

## الوظيفة (Function) :
  • To obtain a large force on the large piston by applying a small force to the small piston.

## فكرة العمل (Working Principle) :
  • Based on Pascal’s Law (قاعدة باسكال).

# Analysis :
  • The diagram and text together illustrate how a small force applied to the small piston is transmitted via incompressible hydraulic fluid to produce a larger force on the larger piston, exemplifying Pascal’s Law in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.641,r=0.937,b=0.922), with ID 1760b844-0d7d-4b91-ab48-f855a826fd26 -->
