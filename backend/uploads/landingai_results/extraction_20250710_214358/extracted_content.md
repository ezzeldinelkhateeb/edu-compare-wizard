Summary : This is a labeled illustration of a hydraulic fluid system, showing two pistons of different areas connected by a U-shaped tube filled with liquid, used to demonstrate the principles of hydraulic pressure and force transmission.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • The diagram shows a U-shaped container filled with a liquid labeled "السانل الهيدروليكي" (hydraulic fluid).
  • On the left side, a large piston with area "A" is acted upon by an upward force "F".
  • On the right side, a smaller piston with area "a" is acted upon by a downward force "f".
  • The heights of the pistons above a reference level are marked as "y2" (left) and "y1" (right).
  • The system is labeled as "شكل (1)" (Figure 1).
  • The image is from "الدرس الخامس" (Lesson Five).

Technical Details :
  • The pistons are shown as circular disks fitting tightly in the vertical tubes.
  • The liquid level is continuous between the two arms of the U-tube.
  • The forces and areas are clearly labeled: "F" and "A" on the left, "f" and "a" on the right.
  • Vertical distances "y2" and "y1" are indicated with dashed lines and arrows.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The left piston (larger area) is higher than the right piston (smaller area).
  • The forces are applied in opposite directions: upward on the left, downward on the right.
  • The system visually demonstrates the transmission of force through the incompressible fluid.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually explains Pascal's principle, showing how a force applied to a larger area piston can be transmitted through a fluid to produce a different force on a smaller area piston.
  • The difference in piston areas and heights suggests a mechanical advantage, foundational to hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.064,t=0.061,r=0.415,b=0.252), with ID 775a8e84-daab-4735-b103-75c30e4dd63c -->

Summary : This illustration demonstrates the principle of hydraulic systems, showing how a force applied to a large piston is transmitted through an incompressible fluid to a smaller piston, resulting in a different force output.

illustration:
Hydraulic System Overview :
  • Two vertical cylinders of different diameters are connected at the base by a U-shaped tube filled with liquid.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with piston area "A" and force "F" applied downward.
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area "a" and force "f" applied downward.
  • Both pistons are shown pressing down on the liquid, with the liquid level equal in both arms.

Labels & Notation :
  • Left piston: "A" (area), "F" (force).
  • Right piston: "a" (area), "f" (force).
  • Dashed horizontal line indicates equal liquid level.
  • All text is in Persian, with the figure labeled as "شکل ۲" (Figure 2).

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or units are provided.
  • The system is closed and the pistons are shown as tight-fitting.
  • The illustration is schematic, not to scale.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The larger piston/cylinder is on the left, the smaller on the right.
  • Both pistons are at the same vertical height relative to the liquid surface.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually explains Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The system demonstrates how a small force on a large area (F on A) can be converted to a larger force on a smaller area (f on a), or vice versa, depending on the relative sizes of A and a.
  • The equal liquid levels indicate equilibrium, suggesting F/A = f/a. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.472,r=0.278,b=0.611), with ID 7c2b8ee6-2c42-499a-b6c6-1dec88d85ed4 -->

Summary : This figure compares the pressure relationships in hydraulic systems with pistons at different levels, illustrating how pressure is transmitted and calculated in each scenario according to Pascal's principle.

diagram:  
# Pistons at Different Levels :  
  • The figure is divided into three panels, each showing a U-shaped tube filled with liquid and two pistons of different areas (a and A) at each end.  
  • The left and middle panels show pistons at different vertical levels, while the right panel shows pistons at the same horizontal level.

## Left Panel – Pistons at Different Levels :  
  • The left diagram shows piston 1 (area a) at a lower level than piston 2 (area A).  
  • Forces f and F are applied to pistons 1 and 2, respectively.  
  • The height difference between the pistons is labeled h.  
  • The pressure equality is given as P₁ = P₂.  
  • The pressure equation is:  
    f/a = F/A + ρgh

## Middle Panel – Pistons at Different Levels (Alternate) :  
  • Similar to the left panel, but the liquid column is higher on the left side.  
  • The same variables and relationships are shown:  
    f/a + ρgh = F/A

## Right Panel – Pistons at the Same Level :  
  • Both pistons are at the same horizontal level.  
  • Forces f and F are applied to pistons 1 and 2, respectively.  
  • The pressure equality is given as P₁ = P₂.  
  • The pressure equation is:  
    f/a = F/A

# Equations and Variables :  
  • f: Force applied to piston 1 (area a)  
  • F: Force applied to piston 2 (area A)  
  • ρ: Density of the liquid  
  • g: Acceleration due to gravity  
  • h: Height difference between pistons  
  • a, A: Areas of pistons 1 and 2, respectively

# Headings and Labels :  
  • Top left and middle: "المكبسـان في مستويين مختلفين" ("Pistons at different levels")  
  • Top right: "المكبسـان في نفس المستوى الأفقي" ("Pistons at the same horizontal level")

Analysis :  
  • The diagrams illustrate how the pressure transmission in a hydraulic system depends on the relative heights of the pistons.  
  • When pistons are at different levels, the pressure difference includes a hydrostatic term (ρgh) due to the height difference.  
  • When pistons are at the same level, the pressure is transmitted directly according to the ratio of forces to areas, with no hydrostatic correction.  
  • The figure visually reinforces Pascal's principle and the effect of fluid column height on pressure transmission. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.108,t=0.651,r=0.888,b=0.892), with ID bf4250ac-fcf9-4851-bb30-bb5fc2731a46 -->
