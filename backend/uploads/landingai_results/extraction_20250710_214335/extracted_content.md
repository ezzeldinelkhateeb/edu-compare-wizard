Summary : This is a labeled illustration and accompanying explanation of a hydraulic system demonstrating Pascal's principle, showing how force applied to a small piston is transmitted through a hydraulic fluid to a larger piston, resulting in a larger output force.

illustration:
# System Overview :
  • Two connected cylinders (left and right) filled with hydraulic fluid ("السائل الهيدروليكي").
  • Left cylinder: large piston with area A, force F applied upward.
  • Right cylinder: small piston with area a, force f applied downward.
  • Both pistons are at the same horizontal level (y₁ = y₂).

# Labels & Notation :
  • Left piston: area A, force F, height y₁.
  • Right piston: area a, force f, height y₂.
  • Both pistons are shown with arrows indicating direction of applied force.
  • The fluid is labeled as "السائل الهيدروليكي" (hydraulic fluid).
  • Figure is labeled "(شكل 1)" (Figure 1).

# Textual Explanation :
  • Describes that when both pistons are at the same level and a force f is applied to the small piston, a pressure P is generated at the bottom of the small piston: P = f / a.
  • This pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid to the bottom of the large piston, resulting in an upward force F on the large piston: P = F / A.
  • The explanation is in Arabic and references Pascal's principle.

# Analysis :
  • The figure visually demonstrates Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished in all directions.
  • The system amplifies force: a small input force on a small piston produces a larger output force on a larger piston, proportional to the ratio of their areas.
  • The diagram and equations clarify the relationship between input and output forces in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID 92ad2427-c901-4eef-b2dc-53911d52925b -->

Summary : This illustration shows a hydraulic system with two connected cylinders of different cross-sectional areas, each fitted with a piston and subjected to different forces.

illustration:
Hydraulic System Overview :
  • Two vertical cylinders are connected at the base, forming a U-shaped container filled with liquid.
  • The left cylinder is larger, labeled with piston area "A" and force "F" applied downward.
  • The right cylinder is smaller, labeled with piston area "a" and force "f" applied downward.
  • Both pistons are shown pressing down on the liquid, with the liquid level equal in both arms.

Labels & Notation :
  • Left piston: "A" (area), "F" (force).
  • Right piston: "a" (area), "f" (force).
  • Dashed horizontal line indicates equal liquid level.
  • Persian text at the bottom: "شکل ۲" (Figure 2).

Spatial Relationships :
  • The larger piston (left) and smaller piston (right) are at the same liquid height, indicating pressure transmission.
  • The system visually demonstrates Pascal's principle.

Analysis :
  • The figure illustrates the principle that pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The difference in piston areas suggests a mechanical advantage, where a small force on the small piston can balance a larger force on the large piston if the ratio of forces equals the ratio of areas. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.061,t=0.476,r=0.270,b=0.615), with ID b61ca6f3-daed-430e-8d81-eb9bd0375dd9 -->

# Title & Layout :
  • Title at top: "حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار" ("States of the Hydraulic Piston at Equilibrium").
  • Three side-by-side panels, each showing a U-shaped hydraulic system with two pistons (labeled 1 and 2) and annotated forces, areas, and heights.
  • Left and center panels: "المكبان في مستويين مختلفين" ("Pistons at Different Levels").
  • Right panel: "المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي" ("Pistons at the Same Horizontal Level").

# Left Panel (Pistons at Different Levels, piston 1 higher) :
  • Piston 1 (left) at height h above piston 2 (right).
  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F to piston 2 (area A).
  • Fluid height difference h between pistons.
  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
  • Equation: f/a = F/A + ρgh.

# Center Panel (Pistons at Different Levels, piston 2 higher) :
  • Piston 2 (right) at height h above piston 1 (left).
  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F to piston 2 (area A).
  • Fluid height difference h between pistons.
  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
  • Equation: f/a + ρgh = F/A.

# Right Panel (Pistons at Same Level) :
  • Both pistons at the same horizontal level.
  • Force f applied to piston 1 (area a), force F to piston 2 (area A).
  • No height difference.
  • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
  • Equation: f/a = F/A.

# Symbols & Annotations :
  • f: force on small piston (area a).
  • F: force on large piston (area A).
  • h: height difference between pistons.
  • ρ: fluid density.
  • g: gravitational acceleration.
  • P₁, P₂: pressures at pistons 1 and 2.

# Analysis :
  • The figure demonstrates how the pressure balance in a hydraulic system depends on the relative heights of the pistons.
  • When pistons are at different heights, the hydrostatic pressure term (ρgh) must be included in the force-area relationship.
  • When pistons are at the same level, the relationship simplifies to a direct proportion between force and area.
  • The diagrams and equations together clarify the effect of height difference on hydraulic equilibrium. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID 54eae4a4-72bb-436d-84c0-a86a492693aa -->
