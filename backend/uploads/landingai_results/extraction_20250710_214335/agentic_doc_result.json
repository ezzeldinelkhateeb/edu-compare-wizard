through a hydraulic fluid to a larger piston, resulting in a larger output force.\n\nillustration:\n# System Overview :\n  • Two connected cylinders (left and right) filled with hydraulic fluid (\"السائل الهيدروليكي\").\n  • Left cylinder: large piston with area A, force F applied upward.\n  • Right cylinder: small piston with area a, force f applied downward.\n  • Both pistons are at the same horizontal level (y₁ = y₂).\n\n# Labels & Notation :\n  • Left piston: area A, force F, height y₁.\n  • Right piston: area a, force f, height y₂.\n  • Both pistons are shown with arrows indicating direction of applied force.\n  • The fluid is labeled as \"السائل الهيدروليكي\" (hydraulic fluid).\n  • Figure is labeled \"(شكل 1)\" (Figure 1).\n\n# Textual Explanation :\n  • Describes that when both pistons are at the same level and a force f is applied to the small piston, a pressure P is generated at the bottom of the small piston: P = f / a.\n  • This pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid to the bottom of the large piston, resulting in an upward force F on the large piston: P = F / A.\n  • The explanation is in Arabic and references Pascal's principle.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure visually demonstrates Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished in all directions.\n  • The system amplifies force: a small input force on a small piston produces a larger output force on a larger piston, proportional to the ratio of their areas.\n  • The diagram and equations clarify the relationship between input and output forces in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.081,t=0.072,r=0.892,b=0.243), with ID 92ad2427-c901-4eef-b2dc-53911d52925b -->\n\n- إذا سببت القوة F في تحريك المكبس الصغير مسافة 𝑦₁ لأسفل

in a hydraulic system depends on the relative heights of the pistons.\n  • When pistons are at different heights, the hydrostatic pressure term (ρgh) must be included in the force-area relationship.\n  • When pistons are at the same level, the relationship simplifies to a direct proportion between force and area.\n  • The diagrams and equations together clarify the effect of height difference on hydraulic equilibrium. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.626,r=0.893,b=0.906), with ID 54eae4a4-72bb-436d-84c0-a86a492693aa -->\n\nحيث : (ρ) كثافة السائل ، (h) ارتفاع عمود السائل بين المكبسين.
