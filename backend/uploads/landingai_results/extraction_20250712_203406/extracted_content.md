Summary : This is a labeled illustration and explanatory text describing the operation of a hydraulic press, showing how force and pressure are transmitted through a hydraulic fluid between two pistons of different areas.

illustration:
# Diagram :
  • Shows two connected cylinders filled with hydraulic fluid, each with a piston (one large, one small).
  • The left cylinder has a large piston labeled "A" with an upward force "F" applied.
  • The right cylinder has a small piston labeled "a" with a downward force "f" applied.
  • Heights y1 and y2 are marked, indicating the vertical positions of the pistons.
  • The system is labeled as "السائل الهيدروليكي" (hydraulic fluid).
  • The diagram is labeled as "(شكل 1)" (Figure 1).

# Equations and Explanations :
  • States that when the pistons are at the same horizontal level, a force F applied to the small piston creates a pressure P = f/a at the bottom of the small piston.
  • This pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid to the bottom of the large piston.
  • The force F on the large piston is related to the pressure by P = F/A.
  • The text explains the principle of pressure transmission in hydraulic systems.

# Analysis :
  • The figure visually demonstrates Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The equations show how a small force applied to a small-area piston can generate a larger force on a larger-area piston, illustrating the mechanical advantage of hydraulic presses.
  • The diagram and text together clarify the relationship between force, area, and pressure in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.065,t=0.069,r=0.913,b=0.240), with ID 35f2cfe0-3634-4053-8350-27ad1b97b94a -->

- إذا تسببت القوة F في تحريك المكبس الصغير مسافة 𝑦₁ لأسفل فإن المكبس الكبير يتأثر بقوة F وتسبب تحريكه مسافة 𝑦₂ لأعلى، وبتطبيق قانون بقاء الطاقة (في حالة المكبس الهيدروليكي المثالي) فإن :

Summary : This illustration demonstrates the principle of hydraulic systems, showing how a force applied to a large piston is transmitted through a fluid to a smaller piston, resulting in a different force output.

illustration:
Hydraulic System Setup :
  • Two vertical cylinders are connected at the base by a horizontal tube, forming a U-shaped container filled with fluid.
  • The left cylinder contains a large piston labeled "A" with area A, and a downward force "F" is applied to it.
  • The right cylinder contains a smaller piston labeled "a" with area a, and a downward force "f" is applied to it.
  • The fluid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.

Labels & Notation :
  • Left piston: "A" (area), "F" (applied force, downward arrow).
  • Right piston: "a" (area), "f" (applied force, downward arrow).
  • Dashed horizontal line marks the equal fluid level.
  • Persian text at the bottom: "شکل ۲" (Figure 2).

Spatial Relationships :
  • The left piston and cylinder are larger than the right.
  • Both pistons are at the same fluid height, indicating pressure balance.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually represents Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.
  • The system illustrates how a small force on a small piston can balance a larger force on a larger piston if the ratio of forces equals the ratio of areas (F/A = f/a).
  • This is the foundational concept behind hydraulic lifts and presses. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.476,r=0.267,b=0.616), with ID 7a7ce8f2-8cc8-4d52-b6fe-82af227ae18f -->

Summary : This figure illustrates the equilibrium states of a hydraulic press (hydraulic piston system) under different configurations, showing the relationship between forces, areas, and fluid pressure when the pistons are at the same or different heights.

diagram:
# Title :
  • "حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار" (States of the Hydraulic Press at Equilibrium).

# Configurations :
  ## Left Panel – Pistons at Different Levels (المكبان في مستويين مختلفين) :
    • Diagram shows two pistons (left: small area a, right: large area A) at different heights, with the right piston higher.
    • Forces: Small force f applied on left piston, large force F on right piston.
    • Height difference h between fluid surfaces under the pistons.
    • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
    • Equation: f/a = F/A + ρgh.

  ## Middle Panel – Pistons at Different Levels (المكبان في مستويين مختلفين) :
    • Diagram similar to left, but now the left piston is higher than the right.
    • Forces: Small force f on left piston, large force F on right piston.
    • Height difference h, but reversed.
    • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
    • Equation: f/a + ρgh = F/A.

  ## Right Panel – Pistons at Same Level (المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي) :
    • Both pistons are at the same horizontal level.
    • Forces: Small force f on left piston, large force F on right piston.
    • No height difference.
    • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.
    • Equation: f/a = F/A.

# Equations :
  • For each configuration, the pressure at both pistons is set equal, with the effect of height difference (ρgh) included when pistons are at different levels.

# Visual Elements :
  • Each panel contains a labeled diagram of a U-shaped hydraulic system with pistons, fluid, and force arrows.
  • Variables: f (small force), F (large force), a (small area), A (large area), h (height difference), ρ (fluid density), g (gravity).

# Analysis :
  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal on both sides (f/a = F/A).
  • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference due to the fluid column (ρgh) must be added or subtracted depending on which piston is higher.
  • This illustrates Pascal’s principle and the effect of hydrostatic pressure in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.121,t=0.625,r=0.891,b=0.905), with ID 93050a66-69c8-4c2c-be18-081937eef727 -->
