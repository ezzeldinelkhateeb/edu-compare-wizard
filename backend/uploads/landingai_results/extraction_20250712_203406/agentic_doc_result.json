between two pistons of different areas.\n\nillustration:\n# Diagram :\n  • Shows two connected cylinders filled with hydraulic fluid, each with a piston (one large, one small).\n  • The left cylinder has a large piston labeled \"A\" with an upward force \"F\" applied.\n  • The right cylinder has a small piston labeled \"a\" with a downward force \"f\" applied.\n  • Heights y1 and y2 are marked, indicating the vertical positions of the pistons.\n  • The system is labeled as \"السائل الهيدروليكي\" (hydraulic fluid).\n  • The diagram is labeled as \"(شكل 1)\" (Figure 1).\n\n# Equations and Explanations :\n  • States that when the pistons are at the same horizontal level, a force F applied to the small piston creates a pressure P = f/a at the bottom of the small piston.\n  • This pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid to the bottom of the large piston.\n  • The force F on the large piston is related to the pressure by P = F/A.\n  • The text explains the principle of pressure transmission in hydraulic systems.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure visually demonstrates Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.\n  • The equations show how a small force applied to a small-area piston can generate a larger force on a larger-area piston, illustrating the mechanical advantage of hydraulic presses.\n  • The diagram and text together clarify the relationship between force, area, and pressure in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.065,t=0.069,r=0.913,b=0.240), with ID

systems, showing how a force applied to a large piston is transmitted through a fluid to a smaller piston, resulting in a different force output.\n\nillustration:\nHydraulic System Setup :\n  • Two

downward force \"F\" is applied to it.\n  • The right cylinder contains a smaller piston labeled \"a\" with area a, and a downward force \"f\" is applied to it.\n  • The fluid level is the same on both sides, indicating equilibrium.\n\nLabels & Notation :\n  • Left piston: \"A\" (area), \"F\" (applied force, downward arrow).\n  • Right piston: \"a\" (area), \"f\" (applied force, downward arrow).\n  • Dashed horizontal line marks the equal fluid level.\n  • Persian text at the bottom: \"شکل ۲\" (Figure 2).\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The left piston and cylinder are larger than the right.\n  • Both pistons are at the same fluid height, indicating pressure balance.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The figure visually represents Pascal's principle: pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid.\n  • The system illustrates how a small force on a small piston can balance a larger force on a larger piston if the ratio of forces equals the ratio of areas (F/A = f/a).\n  • This is the foundational concept behind hydraulic lifts and presses. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.476,r=0.267,b=0.616), with ID 7a7ce8f2-8cc8-4d52-b6fe-82af227ae18f

relationship between forces, areas, and fluid pressure when the pistons are at the same or different heights.\n\ndiagram:\n# Title :\n  • \"حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار\" (States of the Hydraulic Press at Equilibrium).\n\n# Configurations :\n  ## Left Panel – Pistons at Different Levels (المكبان في مستويين مختلفين) :\n    • Diagram shows two pistons (left: small area a, right: large area A) at different heights, with the right piston higher.\n    • Forces: Small force f applied on left piston, large force F on right piston.\n    • Height difference h between fluid surfaces under the pistons.\n    • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n    • Equation: f/a = F/A + ρgh.\n\n  ## Middle Panel – Pistons at Different Levels (المكبان في مستويين مختلفين) :\n    • Diagram similar to left, but now the left piston is higher than the right.\n    • Forces: Small force f on left piston, large force F on right piston.\n    • Height difference h, but reversed.\n    • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n    • Equation: f/a + ρgh = F/A.\n\n  ## Right Panel – Pistons at Same Level (المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي) :\n    • Both pistons are at the same horizontal level.\n    • Forces: Small force f on left piston, large force F on right piston.\n    • No height difference.\n    • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n    • Equation: f/a = F/A.\n\n# Equations :\n  • For each configuration, the pressure at both pistons is set equal, with the effect of height difference (ρgh) included when pistons are at different levels.\n\n# Visual Elements :\n  • Each panel contains a labeled diagram of a U-shaped hydraulic system with pistons, fluid, and force arrows.\n  • Variables: f (small force), F (large force), a (small area), A (large area), h (height difference), ρ (fluid density), g (gravity).\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal on both sides (f/a = F/A).\n  • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference due to the fluid column (ρgh) must be added or subtracted depending on which piston is higher.\n  • This illustrates Pascal’s principle and the effect of hydrostatic pressure in hydraulic systems. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.121,t=0.625,r=0.891,b=0.905), with ID 93050a66-69c8-4c2c-be18-081937eef727 -->\n\nحيث : (ρ) كثافة السائل ، (h) ارتفاع عمود السائل بين المكبسين. <!-- text, from

      "text": "Summary : This figure illustrates the equilibrium states of a hydraulic press (hydraulic piston system) under different configurations, showing the relationship between forces, areas, and fluid pressure when the pistons are at the same or different heights.\n\ndiagram:\n# Title :\n  • \"حالات المكبس الهيدروليكي عند الاستقرار\" (States of the Hydraulic Press at Equilibrium).\n\n# Configurations :\n  ## Left Panel – Pistons at Different Levels (المكبان في مستويين مختلفين) :\n    • Diagram shows two pistons (left: small area a, right: large area A) at different heights, with the right piston higher.\n    • Forces: Small force f applied on left piston, large force F on right piston.\n    • Height difference h between fluid surfaces under the pistons.\n    • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n    • Equation: f/a = F/A + ρgh.\n\n  ## Middle Panel – Pistons at Different Levels (المكبان في مستويين مختلفين) :\n    • Diagram similar to left, but now the left piston is higher than the right.\n    • Forces: Small force f on left piston, large force F on right piston.\n    • Height difference h, but reversed.\n    • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n    • Equation: f/a + ρgh = F/A.\n\n  ## Right Panel – Pistons at Same Level (المكبان في نفس المستوى الأفقي) :\n    • Both pistons are at the same horizontal level.\n    • Forces: Small force f on left piston, large force F on right piston.\n    • No height difference.\n    • Pressure equality: P₁ = P₂.\n    • Equation: f/a = F/A.\n\n# Equations :\n  • For each configuration, the pressure at both pistons is set equal, with the effect of height difference (ρgh) included when pistons are at different levels.\n\n# Visual Elements :\n  • Each panel contains a labeled diagram of a U-shaped hydraulic system with pistons, fluid, and force arrows.\n  • Variables: f (small force), F (large force), a (small area), A (large area), h (height difference), ρ (fluid density), g (gravity).\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The figure demonstrates that when pistons are at the same level, the force-to-area ratio is equal on both sides (f/a = F/A).\n  • When pistons are at different heights, the pressure difference due to the fluid column (ρgh) must be added or subtracted depending on which piston is higher.\n  • This illustrates Pascal’s principle and the effect of hydrostatic pressure in hydraulic systems.",
